INTRODUCTION

Introduction
“books,” each one providing resources at every step of the way. The vast
majority of the content of each book is made up of random generation
tables that I’ve created over a quarter of a century (sigh) for my own
use. I should say up front that these are tables for deep design – in
other words, most of them are too long, and contain too many unusual
or contradictory entries, for use on the spot at the gaming table. There
are already many excellent books of tables for use on the fly; the tables
in these books are different. They work best as a tool for preparation
beforehand, providing relatively vast creative resources for browsing
and gathering, rather than quick-use tables designed to provide broad,
fast brushstrokes. My shorter tables tend to deliver cryptic results
designed to shock the reader’s creativity into filling in the gaps, whereas
my longer tables are unusably vast for easy random generation, being
designed to shock the reader’s creativity into operation by presenting a
sea of possibilities.

A fantasy adventure game, at its very heart, is about developing an
open-ended “story” of the characters. The referee is in charge of the
fantasy world, and the players direct the actions of their characters in
that fantasy world. Neither the referee nor the group of players has
complete control over what’s going to happen, and the result is an
evolving set of surprises for both the referee and the players. Unlike
the players, as the referee and creator of the game world, most of your
“work” is done ahead of time. To some degree or other, you have to
create the groundwork for the adventure before the game starts. Even
though no battle plan survives contact with the enemy – and if you’re
an experienced referee you know exactly what I mean – the game has
to start … with a starting point. This might just be a vague set of ideas,
or it might be as complex as a set of maps with a detailed key and well
thought-out encounters for the players to run into.
The Ultimate Book of Adventure Design is organized as a series of

Creativity
Creativity is the ultimate heart of adventure design; producing a
masterpiece adventure involves many interlocking skills and talents,
but the foremost talent of all is the ability to tap into the depths of
the fantastic imagination and draw forth something startling and
unexpected. Creativity is not an easy skill to teach, but if you’re
reading this book it’s a fair assumption that you’re not in the ranks of
those who truly have difficulties with creative thought. You don’t need
to learn the basics, and you might not even need much help with the
highest reaches of the art. Either way, you know what I mean when I
say that there’s a mindset, a condition of openness, in which you’re on
fire – and when it’s not there, you’re basically screwed. How do you
get into that mindset, where you can grab ideas from thin air and whisk
them together with seeming effortlessness?
Virtually every prominent adventure author I’ve talked with about this
question has answered it in the same way. A creative adventure begins
with a visual image of some kind. It might be dreamlike or hazy; it
might seem, at first, to be nothing of consequence; or it might leap forth,
demanding to be drawn into writing. But it’s quite clear that a visual
image is the most common form of “first inspiration” for an adventure.
In my conversations with Rob Kuntz (one of the foundational authors
of Dungeons & Dragons) about creativity, Rob was quite definite
that visual imagery is key to his own first inspirations. Harley Stroh,
author of a number of modules for the Dungeon Crawl Classics line by
Goodman Games, agrees. In an interview with Bruce Cordell (Return to
the Tomb of Horrors, Sunless Citadel) on montecook.com, Bruce was
asked about his inspiration for the key monster in one of his modules.
The answer? “There was this old horror movie I saw years ago….”
So, how do we achieve these visual images – “the force that through
the green fuse drives the flower,” as Dylan Thomas might say? And
it’s a question cutting to the whole value of this book itself. After all,
if visual imagery is the key to creativity, isn’t the ideal creative tool
going to be a book of images and pictures rather than a book of random
generation tables?

In other words, if I may put my own spin on Einstein’s famous quote,
one visual image doesn’t lead directly to another visual image except
through some other process. The key to creating unique visual images is
to tap that other process – and that other process is the manipulation and
recombination of concepts. Let’s look at another quote from Einstein:
“The physical entities which seem to serve as elements in
thought are certain signs and more-or-less clear images which can
be ‘voluntarily’ reproduced and combined. The above-mentioned
elements are, in my case, of visual and some of muscular type.”
– Albert Einstein
Again, we’ve got visual images mentioned in the creative mix
Einstein describes; but notice that the key factor is the combination
of “signs” and “images.” Deep creativity is a cloud-realm of diverse
symbols and images; combining and diverging, seeking the unforeseen.
And so, in fact, we reach the driving force of this book. To the fullest
extent possible, the tables in the Ultimate Book of Adventure Design are
designed to simulate the cloud-realm of deep creativity; to provide an
entry into the disembodied mix of symbols, portents and images that
populate the subconscious mind; to jar the reader – quite artificially
– into the creative cloud. And thereby to create a pathway so that the
mind may follow more easily into this strange realm. It’s no accident
that the first cover illustration for this volume focuses upon opening a
doorway.
With all that said, how does one best use this book to enter the realm
of deep creativity? Here’s my advice. First off, whatever results you roll
with your dice, treat the results not as words, but as pictures, abstracts,
concepts, symbols, or meanings. Treat each result as a half-formed idea,
ready for combination with others – leave it to drift in your mind while
you’re accumulating more random results. And then, once something
starts to coalesce – stop rolling dice! Daydream for a minute, waiting to
see if you’ve got something, and if it isn’t there yet, then start browsing
through the tables looking for whatever “second part” of that idea is
going to click it into shape.

No.

Drift, and find.

“Problems cannot be solved at the same level of
consciousness that created them.” – Albert Einstein

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS

Introduction to Book One
of iron gates and an iron golem. The castle’s history and villains
(other than the golem) developed from those flashes of imagery,
not the other way around. There’s no way of knowing whether your
creativity will happen to be working from top-down or from bottomup, so keep that in mind. If the tables in this book aren’t working for
you, try approaching it in the other direction using tables from later
books. In particular, I often use the Monster Tables (planned as the
next book in the series) as an independent starting point for generating
adventure ideas.

This first book is about the topmost level of adventure design: a
cardinal rule, the elements of a good adventure, the location, the
villain’s plan, and the adventurers’ mission. These all provide context
– the framework upon which the details hang. Oddly – and I’ve had
this confirmed to me by several brilliant adventure authors – the
context is often not the starting point for creating an adventure. In
many cases, such as Rob Kuntz’s Maure Castle, the “spark” came
from a detail rather than from the context. Rob has written that Maure
Castle originated with imagery from a Conan story: the visual pictures

Adventure Design:
General Principles
The Cardinal Rule of
Adventure Design

Creating an Adventure:
The Elements of a
Masterpiece

A good adventure should maximize meaningful player decisions.
An adventure is the setting in which players make decisions for
their characters. It doesn’t matter whether you’re running a science
fiction roleplaying game, an old west roleplaying game, or a fantasy
roleplaying game. Players making decisions is what it’s all about.
From your perspective as the adventure designer, there are lots of
tricks you can use to make a good adventure into a great adventure,
but if you ignore the importance of player decisions you risk making
an otherwise good adventure into a failed gaming experience both for
you and for your players. Thus, the cardinal rule of adventure design:
seek to maximize the number of meaningful, potentially-informed
decisions the players can make during the course of the adventure.
By “meaningful,” I mean that the decisions aren’t just trivial options
with no real influence on what’s going to happen. And by “potentiallyinformed,” I mean that the players should have enough information – or
the potential to have gotten that information – to make a good decision
rather than an arbitrary selection between options. If bad informationgathering or failure to interpret clues is the reason why the players don’t
have all the information they need, then that’s their problem – it’s a
matter of player skill, and they goofed. But on the other hand, if they
play a smart game, brilliantly gathering information and interpreting
clues, they should encounter your adventure as a series of choices in
which (for the most part) they can use the information to improve their
chances of success as they proceed.
Virtually every “trick” of good adventure design hangs on this single
rule. Maximize meaningful player decisions.

There are a few distinct components of a good adventure; even the
simplest, most bare-bones adventure should contain all of these parts. If
you’re an experienced game master, at some point you’ve created tiny little
scenarios that somehow managed to be the most memorable adventures of
all time for your group. And on the other hand, you’ve seen some of your
great creations fall flat. What was the difference? Why did a scrap of an
idea work out so much better than the well-planned masterpiece? One very
good possibility is this: the scrap of idea happened to contain all of the right
components (listed below), and the masterpiece somehow left out one or
more of them. In fact, this is one of the great perils of the well-constructed
adventure. When you’re creating on the fly, at the gaming table, you dream
up new stuff when you see that something isn’t working right. If you’re
working from an adventure you created ahead of time, you can still fix the
problem during the game, but let’s face it: the whole reason you wrote your
material ahead of time was so you didn’t need to fix things on the fly.

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS
Backstory

Race Against Time

The backstory is the answer to a question: what happened to change
this location from a normal place into a dangerous place of adventure,
with treasures and monsters? Players love to discover the answer to
this question, and an adventure feels incomplete, from the players’
perspective, if it ends without this loose end being tied up. If the
backstory is too complicated to be fully discovered or understood, then
it’s too complicated for an adventure. Backstory creates the MYSTERY
of the location. It can be as simple as: “A wizard once lived here, and
he died, and monsters moved in.” But an adventure with absolutely no
backstory for the players to discover is like a play where something
isn’t explained by the final curtain. It leaves a sense of dissatisfaction
and incompleteness. Having some backstory – purely for the purpose
of giving the players something to discover – is actually one of the few
tricks of adventure design that doesn’t come from the cardinal rule of
maximizing player decisions.

Whether it’s a major or a minor component of the adventure, some
aspect of the adventure must create a race against time – even if it’s just
that the party is running low on money to pay their bill at the local inn.
A race against time is what causes the players to have to MANAGE
RESOURCES.

Resource Management

Related to the RACE AGAINST TIME, resource management is an
important factor in virtually all adventures. In fact, you don’t have
to make any sort of deliberate attempt to write it into your adventure,
because the management of hit points and spells is built into the game
system itself. Indeed, if you overdo the resource management side of
an adventure, you risk bogging things down into nothing more than a
bookkeeping session. For very low-level adventurers, the risk of running
out of torches adds excitement and urgency. But if you try to focus on
torches when the characters are high level, you’re driving in the wrong
gear. Okay, so that’s the risk of overdoing resource management. On
the other hand, when it’s done right, having a resource to manage can
create a whole new dimension for player decisions, and a memorable
adventure. You’ve done it many times before, possibly without even
thinking about it very much. Here’s an example: a couple of healing
potions given to a low-level party as a partial “up front” payment for a
mission. In one sense those potions are just treasure, and in another sense
they’re a way to give the party an added bit of strength for confronting
monsters that are a bit more interesting than the run of the mill low
level monsters. But you’ve also added a new dimension to the game:
the decision of when to use them. Deliberately writing a significant
element of resource management into an adventure is probably the
riskiest trick in the adventure designer’s toolbox. When it’s done well,
it adds a lot to the adventure. But you can easily throw off the pace by
creating annoying bookkeeping, or you might accidentally hand out a
resource that can blast away all the adventure’s challenges. Frankly, this
is an art rather than a science. I don’t have any good guidelines for it
other than to say: don’t get too creative with this unless you’re already
an experienced adventure-writer. If you’re relatively inexperienced,
just rely upon whatever resource management challenges are already
built into the game’s rules, and you won’t go far wrong.

Location

The place in which the adventure occurs has to be an interesting
locale, with unusual tactical opportunities and possibly a theme of some
kind. The map should be evaluated as follows: is it a good game board
for tactical movement? If the map doesn’t measure up as a game board,
it won’t measure up for use in a roleplaying game, either. Maps work
the same way in both types of games.

Opposition

The current occupants of the adventure location might or might not be
related to the backstory. In many cases, the backstory just explains why
the place has become a good place for monsters to inhabit. In general,
monsters need not all be unusual, but every adventure should contain
some sort of unique monster, and also use those normal monsters in
an interesting way from time to time. Not all monster encounters must
be wildly unusual, either: having the “normal” ones will highlight the
interest of the unusual ones. It’s a matter of variety.

Variation of Challenge

Players enjoy adventures in which the nature of the challenges they
face are varied. A good adventure will include combats, traps to detect
and avoid, strange tricks to figure out, varied combat terrain, and
negotiations. Challenges also include getting lost (EXPLORATION)
and managing limited resources (RACE AGAINST TIME). A related
point is that obstacles should have variation of solution, as well. Don’t
place challenges that can only be solved in one way – for the players,
making the decision to fight with or to negotiate with a dragon adds an
important dimension to the game.

Milestones and Conclusions

The adventure should contain one or more locations where they can
clearly see that they have achieved a victory against the adventure.
These might be places where they learn a chunk of information about
the BACKSTORY, they might be places where an obviously significant
monster dwells, or they might be mission objectives identified in
advance, such as rescuing prisoners or finding a particular object.
Defeating a “boss” monster is one example of a conclusion, but don’t
make all your adventures follow the pattern of “fight + fight + fight +
defeat boss monster = conclusion.” The same pattern of milestones and
conclusions shouldn’t be repeated too often, or it gets stale.

Exploration

Part of the magic of adventuring is the sense of exploring a strange
place. Getting lost is a serious risk, and the players will need to create
a map of this place in order to return alive. This aspect of an adventure
(especially creating the map directly at the table) is very powerful for
putting the players directly into the atmosphere, but some gaming
groups might find it tedious. It depends on what you want to emphasize,
and what the players enjoy. Of all the adventure components listed
here, exploration is the only one that isn’t necessarily universal. With
some gaming groups, leaving exploration out will destroy the feel of the
adventure. With others, putting it in will be seen as a disastrous waste
of time. Know your group.

Continuation Options

Something about the MYSTERY, LOCATION, or OPPOSITION
gives the adventurers a new direction they might follow. Avoid creating
situations where the players have no choice about their next course
of action. Instead, provide them with possibilities, hints, clues, and
options. A treasure chest containing a map is the classic example of
a continuation option. Nobody’s forced to do anything, but the link to
another adventure is made clearly available.

Example results from the tables above might include things like “The Twilight House of the Vampiric Wolves,” or “The Temporal
Sanctum of the Insatiable Knight.” These are good starting points for the development of an adventure; enough, at least, to start
putting your mind into gear. You might end up with a location that’s completely different from your initial starting point once all the
pieces have fallen into place, been arranged, and been polished. But that’s the nature of the creative process. Getting it started is often
the hardest step.

Approach No. 1: Purpose Approach
Table 1-2 below is not used in conjunction with Table 1-1A or 1-1B; it is an alternative approach to generating seeds for an adventure location.
The table is focused more on the purpose of the location than upon its past or present occupants. This table requires much more creative thinking
than Table 1-1A or 1-1B, because many results will be quite bizarre at first glance. This is deliberate; without strange conjunctions, tables don’t
yield creative results.

Most of the chapters (in later books of the series) dealing with specific adventure locales also contain shorter, more specific tables for generating
locations in that terrain type.

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — MISSIONS

Missions

Another starting approach to adventure design is to start with the
mission facing the players, and see what interesting ideas crop up
about locations or villains. This table isn’t about generating missions
the characters are forced to undertake in a particular way. Rather,
it’s a way to jump-start your creativity into coming up with a more
complex adventure scenario the players might approach in a multitude
of different ways.
Since many mission-based adventures involve an employer, this
section also contains tables for generating patrons. Once you come up
with a combination of mission + patron, other ideas about the adventure
will probably start springing to mind. What might happen if the party
chooses to double-cross the patron? To side with the villain? To go
after the adventure, but with a different mission in mind? To look for
other patrons who might have different motivations? Most of the results
you’ll generate with these tables can be expanded considerably from
the basic seed-ideas.
Finally, there’s a table of possible motivations for the players/
characters themselves. Players don’t like their characters to be “forced”
into a particular adventure – which means you’ve got to offer a reason
to choose one adventure over another. This table of motivations is quite
useful no matter whether your initial creative spark comes from the
Locations tables, the Mission tables, or the Villain’s Motivation tables.

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

The Villain’s Plan
The following tables can be used to get ideas for an adventure, starting with some details about the villain’s plan. The plan need not be
immediately obvious at the start of the adventure, and might not even be discovered until the very end. Note that this section has a master table
(1-11), which directs the reader to one of tables 1-12 through 1-34. Table 1-35 (Minions) stands alone, since it can apply to virtually all of the
other tables.

Master Table of Villainous Plans
Table 1-11: Master Table of Villainous Plans
Die
Roll

Type of Villainous Plan (d100)

01-06

Concealment – the villain is trying to conceal himself,
to conceal his past acts, conceal his organization, conceal
evidence, etc.

07-13

Conversion – the villain is trying to convert others to his
way of thinking (as opposed to subversion, which involves
using them without changing their minds)

14-21

Desecration – the villain seeks to desecrate a location, an
item, or an event (desecration could be targeted on religion
or against a tradition)

22-29

Destroy Community – the villain is trying to kill,
economically destroy, or otherwise irreparably damage
a particular community (possibly a sub-community or
organization). He could have various motives, ranging
from annoyance to following the orders of a greater villain.

Die
Roll

Type of Villainous Plan (d100)

51-57

Food – the villain seeks to get food for himself, a monster,
or for his organization. Basic subsistence is the primary
goal of many lesser villains, while reliable food sources for
minions can be the objective of more powerful leaders

58-64

Gain Favor of Another Villain – the villain wants to
impress someone. He might be trying to impress his boss,
trying to gain an ally, or showing someone that he’s worthy
of employment as a minion.

65-71

Increase Personal Capability – the villain is trying to
increase his inherent personal power. This might include
gaining levels of experience, useful information, magic
items, etc.

72-78

Political Power – the villain seeks to gain direct or
indirect political power at some level of government.

79-81

Random Acts – the villain acts randomly in villainous
ways

30-36

Destroy Good-Aligned Group – the villain seeks to
destroy a good-aligned group, either because their morals
offend him, or as the first step in a larger plan

37-43

Economic Power – the villain is working on gaining
wealth, either as an end in itself or to fund the next step in
a larger plan

82-89

Reputation – the villain is trying to enhance his own
reputation, either as an invincible villain or as a good
person (which would be an infiltration tactic)

Evoke Catastrophic Event – the villain is trying to set
off a natural, magical, psychic, or political disaster. This
might be an end in itself, or the first step in some other
plan.

90-95

Subversion to the Villain’s Purposes – the villain is
trying to mislead people into supporting his nefarious
enterprises

96-00

Support Evil Groups Secretly – the villain is working
behind the scenes to help other evil groups.

44-50

27

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Concealment
Used as a creative tool to generate the start of an adventure, this table gives some details about a villain whose highest priority at the moment is to
simply to hide himself (itself) or the evidence of another plan (past, present, or future). Most likely, this is only the first step in his grand scheme,
but it might be a clean-up operation from a different plan that has just finished for good or ill. The table is primarily for intelligent mastermindtypes; if you’ve already got an unintelligent monster in mind, assume that it’s building a hidden lair of some sort or roll on the Food-Related
Activities table.

Table 1-12: Villainous Concealment
Die
Roll

From Whom

How He’s Concealing It

01-10

Another villain

Assassination. The Villain is targeting anyone who could identify him from a past identity he wants to
keep secret, or is killing those who know about his plans. In other words, the villain might be trying to
conceal himself or his activities; these aren’t always the same. A villain engaged in secret activities might be
completely certain he can’t be identified, but still worried that his plot could be uncovered. Assassinations
might be the last resort when a villainous plot is already starting to fall apart. The villain’s minions might be
his targets, too, if things have gone badly and the villain is concealing his tracks.

11-20

Another villain’s
minions

Eliminating Evidence (damage control). The villain is trying to eliminate evidence of a plan or crime that
failed, and that he has written off. He might be taking several actions at once: killing his own minions that
were involved, killing witnesses, stealing documents and other evidence, etc.

21-30

Eliminating Evidence (mopping up). The villain is eliminating evidence of a plan or crime that
has succeeded – covering his tracks, in other words. If he up a usurper on the throne (to choose one
Bounty hunters or
example), he might still need to kill the minion or dupe who poisoned the true king. Or, he might need
adventurers
to change some historical records that could reveal the usurper’s non-noble pedigree. Most crimes leave
evidence behind.

31-40

Frame-up. The villain is framing another person (or monster) for a crime he committed himself. The target
Bounty hunters or might be a minion, an innocent bystander the villain dislikes, or a monster such as a nearby dragon (dragons
being excellent fall-guys for arsonists). Remember also: from the villain’s perspective, the enemy of his
adventurers
enemy is not his friend – he’s a potential fall guy.

41-50

Foreign
authorities or
military

Lair-Building (rural). The villain is building a concealed lair to hide himself and his activities from the
group indicated in column 1. This could be the activity of a mindless monster (in which case column 1 is
irrelevant), or it might be part of the thought-out plan of a relatively intelligent mastermind.

51-60

Former victim

Lair-Building (urban or village). The villain is building a hidden lair within a civilized community. Again,
this could be the instinctive action of an unintelligent beast (such as a giant spider nesting in an attic, or a
ghoul making tunnels under a cemetery) or might be the first step in a mastermind’s plan (e.g., an evil priest
digging a secret basement-complex).

61-70

Group of
former allies

Organization (façade). The villain is creating an organization of innocent-looking minions in plain
sight, but with a secret agenda for the group. The organization might be a cover story for existing
minions (yes, we are all circus performers!) or it might be a way of recruiting unsuspecting locals to join.
In this sort of operation, the villain is primarily trying to conceal the organization’s secret operations
rather than to conceal himself; he might even be a prominent citizen of the town or village where the
organization is being created. His plan might include recruiting people away from the local community
to a rural “temple” or “lodge,” or the organization’s base might be located right in the middle of the
community (for example, an innocent-looking store that actually fences stolen goods brought in by
caravan from the nearby city). To determine the organization’s secret agenda, you might want to roll
again on the Master Table. Note that this sort of plan is almost certainly the agenda of an intelligent
villain, even if the operation is run by a minion with lower intelligence.

71-80

Local authorities
or militia

Organization (secret). The villain is creating a secret organization of minions, meeting in secret with
no cover story for their activities. This could be a secret cult, a plan to overthrow the government, or the
unification of wererat tribes in the sewer tunnels of a large city. Secret societies can take many forms if you’re
creative.

81-90

Local authorities
or militia

Secret identity (establishing). The villain is disguised within the human population, and is
building up a new identity for himself. He might have forged documents, or an altered body form.
In this case, the villain has created a new identity – if he has taken someone’s place, see below for
comments.

Local authorities
or militia

Secret Identity (learning). The villain has replaced a human in the community, and is learning the details of
his new identity. This is not a strategy limited to shape-changing villains; anyone can pretend to be someone
from far away. The villain might be making some blunders as he impersonates the dead or absent target – he
might not know, for example, that the king was a vegetarian, or where the merchant hid the key to his treasure
room.

91-00

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Conversion
Conversion-type plans are designed to win over the hearts, minds, and possibly souls of the villain’s targets. There is another similar table later
on called “Subversion,” and the distinction is that a conversion plot is designed to change the moral alignment of the target, whereas a subversion
plot can succeed perfectly well if the target never changes at all – as long as the target keeps unknowingly working on the villain’s behalf.

Table 1-13: Conversion
Die
Roll

Conversion Method (d100)

01-05

Addiction. The villain uses peoples’ addictions to get
them to take evil actions

06-10

Bad Advice. The villain advises people to engage in
evil actions, working from some position of authority
he has already obtained (e.g., a good priest, a military
leader, a city alderman, a prosecutor, etc). The villain
might be giving insidious advice to the population at
large (by preaching war, for example), or he might be
in the position of an adviser to a noble, a guildmaster,
or some other powerful person. The “evil vizier” of
Arabian folklore is a prime example of this sort of
villain.

11-15

Blackmail. The villain is blackmailing people into
committing evil actions. These actions might or might
not actually change their alignments, depending in how
you use alignment in your game.

16-20

Debts. The villain is a moneylender or has control of
money (a local exchequer or military quartermaster,
perhaps) and is using peoples’ debts to force them into
undertaking evil actions.

21-25

Demonic Gifts. The villain gives “gifts” of a demon’s
assistance. Eventually, the victim becomes reliant or
even addicted to such help, and falls into the villain’s
(or the demon’s) clutches as a helpless pawn.

26-30

Enchantment. The villain is magically charming
people, then persuading or ordering them to commit
evil actions.

31-35

Hostages. The villain takes hostages, compelling their
kin or the hostages themselves to perform evil actions
in exchange for freedom or good treatment.

36-40

Magic. The villain uses magical means (using an item,
probably) to change the alignment of his victims. The
effect might only work from long-term exposure to the
item, or it might be instantaneous.

41-45

Persuasion. The silver-tongued devil is able to convert
people to his cause by words alone. This might be
through religious conversions, or by persuading people
to take specifically evil actions. This is the “tempter”
type of villain common in European morality tales (eve
and the serpent, Marlowe and Goethe’s versions of the
Doctor Faustus story, etc.)

46-50

Money. The villain simply pays people to take evil
actions.

51-55

Obligations of Honor. The villain is using peoples’
open-ended promises and oaths as a means of getting
evil actions done. The fictionalized mafia of the
Godfather movies is an excellent example: by doing a
favor in exchange for another, unspecified, favor in the
future, the villain can force people to undertake tasks
they wouldn’t have agreed to ahead of time if they had
known what would be required of them.

29

Die
Roll

Conversion Method (d100)

56-60

Minions Give Bad Advice. The villain’s minions
advise evil actions from positions of authority. The
plan is basically the same as “Bad Advice” above, but
performed by the villain’s minions instead of by the
villain himself. The villain remains one step removed
from the dirty work, possibly more anonymous than
someone in a position to be giving advice.

61-65

Minions Take Hostages. The villain’s minions hold
hostages to compel evil actions from the hostage’s
friends or kin. This is like the “Hostages” entry above,
but the minions are the ones on the front line. As
always, the weakness in the plan is that if you want
something done right, you need to do it yourself.

66-70

Minions Use Addictions. The villain’s minions use
peoples’ addictions to get them to take evil actions.
The minions might be supplying people with addictive
substances, might be taking over the operations of
existing suppliers by force or guile, or might be
blackmailing people (assuming the drugs are illegal).

71-75

Minions Use Blackmail. Similar to the “Blackmail”
plot, but the villain’s minions are blackmailing people
into performing evil actions rather than the villain
himself.

76-80

Minions Use Enchantment. The villain’s minions are
charming people to get them to perform evil actions.
This might be the same as “Enchantment” above, but
it might be that the villain himself doesn’t have the
magical capability to enchant people. If the villain’s
minion is able to use such magic, and the villain isn’t,
keep in mind that the minion might have his own secret
agenda.

81-85

Minions Use Magic. The villain’s minions are directly
changing peoples’ moral alignment with the use of
magic – whether this is an inherent capability or by
the use of a powerful magic item (or even an artifact).
As with all minion-type plans, the minions might be
slightly incompetent, or might be intelligent enough to
have their own agenda.

86-90

Minions Use Money. The villain’s minions pay people
to undertake evil actions. This is only different from
“subversion” in that the actions are presumably heinous
enough to cause a possible change in alignment.

91-95

Minions Use Obligations of Honor. The villain has a
minion who is a feudal lord, a crime boss, or who holds
some other station in which people make open-ended
promises to him. At the villain’s request or command,
the minion is able to take advantage of these openended promises to extort actions people would never
directly have agreed to.

96-00

Minions Use Persuasion. The villain’s minions
persuade people into a religious or moral conversion
to evil (or Chaos, depending upon the campaign).
Most likely, the villain has the minion doing the job
because the villain lacks the charisma (or the human
appearance) to pull it off.

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Desecration
In a desecration-type plot, the villain seeks to destroy, subvert, or render meaningless an important location (usually a religious site) or an event
(not always religious). Table 1-14 is used when the villain intends to desecrate a location (50% chance), and Tables 1-15 and 1-16 are used if the
target is an event (50% chance).

Table 1-14: Desecration Plots (Location)
Die Roll

Intended Desecration Method (Location) (d100)

01-10

Conquest. Villain plans to conquer and occupy the holy site by military assault; using a frontal attack, infiltration, or the help of a
traitor.

11-20

Nullification From Afar. The villain plans to counteract the power of a holy site with activities he can perform in another
location. Examples might include such things as building a dark mirror-image location as a counteracting force, or summoning
clouds to hang permanently over a sun temple. Possibilities for this are pretty vast.

21-30

Raze it to the Ground. The villain plans to physically destroy a temple or holy site using an earthquake, burning it, exploding it,
or using some other implement of physical destruction other than a frontal assault.

31-40

Seed of Evil. The villain plans to desecrate the temple or holy site by planting an unholy object on the premises, probably in a
hidden place (but also, possibly, substituting something in plain sight with a duplicate). He might replace the eye of an idol with
the eye of a demon, perhaps he might bury the body of a hanged murderer under the altar, or perhaps a stone soaked in the cursed
waters of La’aashoon might be used to replace a flagstone.

41-50

Stealing the Relics. The villain plans to steal or modify the specific holy item that gives a temple or a holy site its power or
significance. He might be planning to replace it with a worthless forgery, or he might plan just to hide it away. This is a good plot
to introduce two levels of villain – the one who is supposed to arrange the actual theft, and a more powerful master who plans to
use or destroy the relic.

51-60

Target the Congregation. The villain plans to subvert or convert the temple’s congregation into attacking the priests or otherwise
destroying the temple or holy site.

61-70

Target the Priesthood (Guile). The villain plans to eliminate or remove the servants of a holy site by trickery, then occupy,
desecrate, or destroy the site. He might do so by impersonating a messenger from the high priesthood calling the priests away to
an emergency conclave, perhaps. A nearby “natural” disaster might also be used as the decoy.

71-80

Target the Priesthood (Stealth). The villain plans to eliminate the servants of a holy site by stealthy means, allowing him to
occupy, desecrate, or destroy the site at leisure. He might even keep the site open for business afterwards! This sort of plot might
include assassinations, kidnappings, disguised replacements for the missing priests, or man other kinds of nefarious doings.

81-90

Target the Priesthood (Subvert). The villain plans to subvert the priesthood to evil, and use them to desecrate the temple. For
ideas about his methods, you might want to take a look at the “Conversion” and “Subversion” tables (Table 1-13 and Table 1-32)

91-00

Unholy Event. The villain plans to desecrate the temple or holy site by causing some unholy action to take place there. Examples
might include a human sacrifice, the speaking of ancient or blasphemous words, summoning a demon within the precincts, or a
formal rededication of the temple to an evil deity. Most such plots would require someone to get into the site, although it might
not need to be the villain himself.

21-25

Religious: Anniversary of event in life of hero/saint

Crowning or other rites focusing on a particular a person
(person chosen ahead of time, must be that person). This would
be something like the “Queen of the May,” or the local baron,
or some other person who can’t simply be replaced.

26-30

Religious: Astrological Conjunctions

Day of Fasting

31-35

Religious: Commemoration of a local religious event such as
the founding of the local temple or even the conversion of the
baron’s grandfather to the sect.

Handing out some sort of food, from free beer to sacks of
grain, to a blessed piece of fruit. The food might or might not
be prepared or consumed during the ceremony itself.

36-40

Religious: Eclipse

Human sacrifice is part of the ceremony (if chaos/evil cult), or
animal sacrifice (if sect is lawful/good). Ceremony requires
a particular sacrificial victim, chosen ahead of time, fitting
certain criteria.

41-45

Religious: End/beginning of year

Opening and entering an underground area normally kept
sealed

46-50

Religious: Equinox

Planting of seeds

51-55

Religious: Full or new moon

Reading of a particular prayer

Religious: Particular day ordained by the deity or a sacred text

Recitation of articles of authority

66-70

Religious: Planting season (often involving some sort of
fertility rite, either sexual or involving blood if ancient
religions are used as the model).

Re-enactment of an event from the past

71-75

Religious: Scriptural progression. If the religion’s scripture
tracks through the year, the end of one chapter or book and
the beginning of another might be a significant date. For
example, a temple might read from the Book of Autumn, the
Book of Summer, the Book of Spring and the Book of Winter.
The changeover from one to the next might involve unusual
ceremonies or a festival.

Re-enactment of an event from the religion’s mythology

76-80

Religious: Solstice (closest and farthest point from sun)

Rite of passage is part of the ceremony. Requires presence of
the candidates at the very least.

81-85

Secular or Religious: rites of passage or coming-of-age
ceremonies. Following the model of ancient religions, these
are almost always different ceremonies for males and females,
and might be on different dates.

Sexual activity; most common at fertility rites or rites of
passage, but possible in any context depending on the culture
or the religion as established in the campaign

86-90

Secular: Celebration of the local lord’s birthday or anniversary. Submersion in water, or other use of water in a ceremony

91-95

Secular: Coronation or other transference of power (at a guild
or in town government, for example).

Traditional dance (the quality of it, or its adherence to
particular standards, might be read as an omen).

96-00

Secular: The opening of a market fair, or a tournament
(assuming that these are wrapped up in enough tradition to be
considered something that could be “desecrated”).

Wild festival in which the normal rules of society are relaxed
(this might be a difficult one for a villain to figure out how to
desecrate).

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Destroy Community
The villain is targeting a community for destruction. Tables follow for the intended method, the villain’s reason for wanting to destroy the
community, and a subtable to provide additional detail if the reason is vengeance.

Table 1-17: Intended Method of Destruction
Die Roll Intended Method of Destruction (d100)
01-05

Anger the Protector. The plan is to cause the community’s destruction by getting a significant protector of the village to depart,
leaving the community at the mercy of predators (including the villain). The protector might be a knight, a powerful cleric, or
some other person. The methods might include framing this protector for crimes, spreading rumors about him, or impersonating
him while committing crimes. Virtually any sort of activity designed to besmirch a person’s reputation might be used.

06-10

Arson. The villain plans to burn everything to the ground, either directly or with the help of a firebug minion.

11-15

Attack! The villain has enough military resources to attack and destroy the community – possibly missing just one key factor.

16-20

Eviction. The villain is (legally) evicting members of the community by using his influence with the legal system, influence with
rulers, false facts, framed evidence of crimes, diverting taxes from reaching tax collectors, etc. This is the “evil landlord” type of
villain who makes an appearance in many of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales.

21-25

Harbor the Menace. The villain plans to (or has already started to) provide a safe lair for a predatory killer, monster, murderer,
trapper, arsonist, etc. The dangerous inhabitant might have been brought in, found and adopted, or actually created by the villain.

26-30

Interdiction or Siege. This sort of plot could include any sort of interdiction of supply or demand. The “standard” use of this
plot as an adventure device is a military blockade or siege; bandits cutting off the road to a village, or the siege of a fortification.
However, there are many subtler ways to use this sort of plot as well. Blessings or information might be the “commodity” that’s
being cut off rather than the more obvious food and trade. The villain might, for example, have manipulated the local high priest
into refusing to perform religious ceremonies, or might have captured him. The interdiction might be limited to a particular
commodity, such as the iron needed for a blacksmithing operation in a local castle. Causing the iron to rust while it’s in transit is
an example of interdiction bearing no resemblance to a straightforward siege. Let your mind roam free for possibilities – this is a
plot with lots of scope for GM creativity.

31-35

Murder. The villain (or a deadly minion) is killing the community one at a time, the old fashioned way. This could be a
straightforward psycho killer or other human-hater on the loose, or it could be a much more intricate plot: watch Tim Burton’s film
version of the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (the one with Johnny Depp) for a really complex example.

36-40

Plague. The villain plans to spread a plague, or is somehow maintaining an existing plague. This might be done with mundane
means such as putting rotting meat into a water supply, it might be a magical plague maintained with the help of a god of disease,
or it might be a magic-user casting uniquely-crafted spells.

41-45

Poison. The villain is poisoning something: water, food, air, animals, crops, clothing, etc.

46-50

Prepare for Battle. The villain is hiring or assembling troops (possibly monstrous) for a direct military assault. The troops might
not yet be well enough trained, or might not be numerous enough for the invasion to begin.

51-55

Provoke Invasion by Impersonation. The villain seeks to provoke someone else into invading the community. He is doing so
by impersonating members of the community while committing crimes, treason, immoral acts, etc. This could be as large-scale as
committing raids against one baron’s villages under the flag of another baron.

56-60

Provoke Invasion by Lies. The villain seeks to provoke an invasion by spreading rumors and lies about the community (e.g., the
village is a hideout for bandits, a guild is plotting the overthrow of the king, a village is harboring a traitor, etc.).

61-65

Remove Skilled Leader. The villain wants to remove a killed leader – not a protector, but someone whose services are vital to
the community. Examples might include a well-known swordsmith, a druid who blesses the crops, or someone who gives wise
counsel. The means of removal might include violence, provoking the community to exile the leader, or poisoning the leader’s
opinion of the community.

66-70

Remove/Destroy Protective Item. The villain’s target is some item that protects the community; he plans to steal it, destroy it, or
nullify its effects.

71-75

Sabotage Source of Income. The villain has a cunning plan to destroy the market for the community’s product. He might plan to
poison the product, sabotage its quality, spread rumors about it, etc.

76-80

Sabotage the Food Source. The villain is eliminating domestic animals or crops, possibly by poison, possibly by slaughter, or
perhaps by theft. He might be calling in predators using some magical capability.

81-85

Smuggle in Beasts. The villain is in the process of enticing, luring, or importing monsters into the area. This could be a plot
involving changelings, shape-shifters, or some other subtlety – or it might be that the villain’s making a dragon-calling whistle.

86-90

Spread Dissention. The villain plans to set members of the community violently against each other by spreading lies and rumors.
This is the Iago-type villain of Shakespeare’s Othello, who puts the right word in the right ear, spreading hatred and distrust where
there was originally friendship and mutual alliance.

91-95

Traps. The villain is setting traps around or in the community. His intention might be to kidnap, or the traps might be lethal.

96-00

Wild West Chaos. The villain is engaging in widespread robbery and burglary, probably with the help of minions. Here, the
villain’s goal is either to take control of the community when law and order break down, or simply to bleed it dry in an orgy of
violence and theft.

01-05

All followers and worshippers of a particular deity

Alter effects of the group’s activities, turning the results into
something deleterious instead of beneficial (poisoning new
wells, appointing cruel masters to run the new orphanage, etc.).
Less creative villains might just be sabotaging the projects once
finished (burning the orphanage instead of turning it into an evil
training ground, for example).

All good-aligned individuals in a particular area

Animal or non-summoned monster trained (or otherwise
prepared by magic, or breeding) to hunt down the targeted

whose leaders are staunchly good)

Arson directed at the residences of members of the community.

of an evil temple not actually part of the government) such as
a requirement to wear an evil symbol or worship an evil idol,
refusal to contribute to the army of an evil warlord, etc.

Anyone returning from a pilgrimage to a particular holy site

Economic sabotage

Indirect murders by poison or traps. Generally this will involve

41-45

Apprentices or henchmen of a powerful good-aligned individual
such as a good wizard. To make this unclear at the outset,
the initial targets might be the apprentices of the original
apprentices.

Infiltration and dissention. The villain has a way to join (or have
one of his minions join) the community, who will then spread
lies that will break the community apart. Faked evidence might
be involved.

Evoke Catastrophic Event
Evoking catastrophic events is a common theme for villains. Generally adventures focused on this sort of villain will involve discovery of the
plot and an attempt to prevent the catastrophe. Since in most cases the catastrophe hasn’t yet taken place, the table focuses mainly on the missing
element the villain hasn’t yet completed. In some cases, the nature of the villain’s plot might not be known ahead of time – in other words, the
party might discover the villain’s plot after attacking his stronghold for a different reason (treasure, usually).

Find Food
Minions and villains have to eat, just like everyone else. This is the best table to use if you’ve already decided that your key monster is nonintelligent or really stupid, but it works even for the subtlest masterminds, too.

Table 1-23: Food-Related Activities
Die Roll

Food-Related Activity (d100)

01-05

The villain/monster feeds on people from within civilization, using a secret identity for cover. This sort of villain might be a
shape-shifter, a cannibal, or a disguised non-human with enough of a bipedal shape to pass for human after dark.

06-10

The villain/monster feeds on people from a hidden place in civilization (does not need to resemble a human, but might)

11-15

The villain/monster has allies nearby that need to be fed. He (or they) steals people, vegetables and grain, or livestock by means of
luring them away or kidnapping them. This sort of approach is taken by a wide variety of creatures ranging from will-o-the-wisps
to cattle rustlers.

16-20

The villain/monster feeds on people or livestock by making stealthy attacks from outside civilization.

21-25

The villain/monster lures people away from civilization to feed at leisure.

26-30

The villain/monster feeds on people by attacking them when they leave the boundaries of civilization. (This is virtually the default
scenario of a monster lurking in the wilderness).

31-35

The villain/monster feeds on people who are given as a sacrifice or tribute by a reluctant community.

36-40

The villain/monster feeds on people who are given as a sacrifice or tribute by willing minions who run the community.

41-45

The villain/monster feeds on people in a way that leaves them alive for future feedings (e.g., parasite or other). The food source
could be souls, blood, morale, ability scores, or even emotions such as jealously.

46-50

The villain/monster feeds on people in a way that leaves them alive for future feedings, but not directly. In addition, the villain
must process the vital essences before eating them. The “processing” is an extra step in the cycle.

51-55

The villain/monster is growing or raising something dangerous as a crop or livestock outside of civilization.

56-60

The villain/monster has a dangerous food source inside civilization (grows poison mushrooms or raises giant rats, for example)

61-65

The villain/monster alters a crop or livestock within civilization to make it usable for his consumption (and probably not for
anyone else’s).

66-70

The villain/monster has taken over an entire community for use as a food source

71-75

The villain/monster has created a community (probably through kidnapping or taking human tribute) as a food source

76-80

The villain/monster is inherently dangerous (possibly an unintelligent monster) and sneaks into community to eat crops, livestock,
or garbage

81-85

The villain/monster lures away livestock or steals crops from civilized area

86-90

The villain/monster or minions eats carrion – stealing bodies, etc. They might be creating “accidental” deaths first, and retrieving
the bodies after or just before burial

91-95

The villain/monster’s food processing operation outside a community is causing environmental-type damage in the community
(fouled water, poisoned grass, clouds of poison gas, etc)

96-00

The villain/monster gets tributes of normal food by using threats of violence, using hostages, taking legal action, etc.

Gain Favor of Another Villain
The villain is either involved with some other villain, or wants to be. This relationship might be that of a minion to a leader; might be the
relationship of a prospective minion to a leader; or could even be the relationship of a leader to his followers, especially if the leader relies on
popularity to remain in his dominant position.

assassinate the leader by creating an accident.

02

Assassinate Leader with Assassins. Villain is a leader’s direct heir or second in command of a hierarchy, and is planning to hire
assassins to remove the annoying impediment.

03

Behind the Throne – Criminal Power. Villain is building up a criminal organization to take over effective control of the targeted
political organization, turning the existing source of authority into a mere figurehead.

04

Behind the Throne – Magical Domination. Villain is planning to dominate the organization’s king or boss using magic, turning
him into a puppet leader.

05

Behind the Throne – Magical Friendship. Villain is preparing to charm the leader using magic (as opposed to utterly dominating
his will).

06

Behind the Throne – Military. Villain has enough forces to influence the leader’s policies already, and is directing the
organization’s activities behind the scenes to his own advantage. The villain threatens (subtly or not) that if the leader does not
accede to the villain’s demands, the villain will use his troops to usurp authority.

07

Behind the Throne – Minion Shapechanger. Villain’s minion is using shapechanging of some sort to impersonate a kidnapped
rival, or even the leader of the organization.

08

Behind the Throne – Simulacrum. Villain seeks to replace the political leader or a rival for power with a simulacrum he
controls.

09

Blackmail Rival – Lies. Villain seeks to blackmail a rival with trumped-up facts.

10

Blackmail Rival – Truth. Villain seeks to blackmail a rival with true facts.

11

Build up Favors. Villain is in control of the police or has the power to prosecute crimes. He is using this power to make various
powerful people indebted to him, so that when he makes his move for power they will support him.

12

Control Food Supply – Contamination. Villain plans to gain control of the food supply by stashing food stocks and then
contamination everyone else’s.

13

Control Food Supply – Dietary Restrictions. Villain plans to gain control of the food supply by creating a hidden stash of a
particular type of food, then imposing dietary restrictions on other kinds of food using religion, law, or heavy taxes.

14

Control Legal System – Bribes. Villain is trying to take control of the legal system in the target area by bribing judges. Note:
almost all organizations have some sort of legal system for resolving disputes – this plot works for guilds and other organizations
as well as cities and baronies.

15

Control Legal System – Intimidate Judges. Villain is trying to take control of the legal system in the target area by blackmailing
or threatening judges. This works well for a villain who is the leader of a criminal underground, but can be used for any size or
type of political organization.

Method (d100)

16

Control Legal System – Replace Judges. Villain is trying to take control of the legal system in the target area by replacing
independent judges with his own minions. His methods could include impeachment, assassination, rigged elections, or subverting/
recruiting the existing judges. He will likely need to use several methods in order to conceal the fact that lots of judges are
suddenly stepping down or disappearing under strange circumstances.

17

Control Work Assignments. Villain seeks to control the assignment of jobs, giving them only to his supporters. This works well
for a villain who is already in a position of some power – a guildmaster, a treasurer, or a labor leader, for instance. This sort of plot
could affect jobs in areas as large as a kingdom or as small as a village, and the nature of the organization could range from royal
courts to thieves guilds to religious organizations.

18

Coup d’Etat. Villain is planning a coup d’etat from the inside, with the help of allies in the community or organization.

19

Create Power Vacuum – Trap. Villain is creating a trap that will kill much of the leadership (collapsing the town hall, for
example), and let him take charge when there is no one else offering effective leadership.

20

Discredit Superior Officer – False Accusations. Villain plans to spread a rumor to his own leader’s superior, indicating that his
leader is involved in treachery.

21

Discredit Superior Officer – False Accusations to followers. Villain plans to spread a rumor to the public at large (or to troops,
or other followers) that his superior officer is engaged in unsuitable behavior.

22

Discredit Superior Officer – Inciting. Villain plans to set his superior officer up for failure by creating and inciting particular
situations the superior officer is supposed to prevent from happening.

23

Discredit Superior Officer – Information. Villain plans to set his superior officer up for failure by giving away vital information
about the superior officer’s operations and plans. This will allow the leader’s enemies or rivals to continually outwit and
outperform the leader (until the villain, as his junior, is asked to take the post).

24

Discredit Superior Officer – Sabotage. Villain plans to set his superior officer up for failure by sabotaging his operations.

25

Dominate population – Addictions. The villain is using an addictive substance (or an addictive event or experience) to bring
members of the population under his thrall.

26

Dominate Population – Mental Domination. The villain is setting up an event that will have a tremendously powerful magical
or mental effect, rendering everyone in the vicinity malleable to the villain’s will.

27

Eliminate Advisor with Assassins. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in command), and is eliminating other
advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to have him assassinated.

28

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up – Crime. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in command), and is eliminating
other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him for a crime actually committed by the villain.

29

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up – Adultery. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in command), and is
eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him for committing adultery (possibly with
the top leader’s wife)

30

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up - Lying. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in command), and is eliminating
other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him for lying to the top leader (or some other serious
lie)

31

Eliminate Advisor with Frame-up – Cowardice. The villain is an advisor to the leader (not second in command), and is
eliminating other advisers. Current method for eliminating the next adviser is to frame him for cowardice.

32

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Crime. Villain is not yet an heir or second in command, but is working his
way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason why the party is getting involved). He plans to
eliminate his current commander by framing him for a crime the villain has already committed.

33

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Adultery. Villain is not yet an heir or second in command, but is working his
way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason why the party is getting involved). He plans to
eliminate his current commander by framing him for adultery.

34

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Cowardice. Villain is not yet an heir or second in command, but is working his
way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason why the party is getting involved). He plans to
eliminate his current commander by framing him for cowardice.

35

Eliminate Current Commander – Frame-up for Dishonor. Villain is not yet an heir or second in command, but is working his
way up the chain (if he has been committing crimes to do so this might be a reason why the party is getting involved). He plans to
eliminate his current commander by framing him for some dishonorable act – lying, for instance.

36

Eliminate Current Leader – Insanity. The villain is somehow causing insanity in the leader so he can shake up the hierarchy to
his own advantage. He is not necessarily the heir to power, but he expects that his position will be significantly advanced by the
leader’s removal.

37

Eliminate Rival – Magical Domination. The villain is planning to magically dominate a rival, turning him into a fall guy,
causing him to resign, causing him to advance the villain in the hierarchy, etc.

38

Eliminate Rival – Magical Friendship. The villain is preparing to charm a rival into becoming his friend and ally, although the
villain does not have enough power to completely dominate the rival.

Method (d100)

39

Fake Miracles. The villain is fooling people into believing that he is performing wonders (these are actually staged events, staged
attacks, staged healing, etc.). Note that these are not necessarily magical miracles – they might be military “victories” against the
villain’s own forces, for instance.

40

False Claim – Dynastic Succession. Villain plans to establish a false (or perhaps even real) claim to power based on the villain’s
family tree. Villain’s purported ancestors were overthrown by the current leader’s ancestors. This is probably done with forged
documents “proving” ancestry or with a last testament and will.

41

False Claim – Family Succession. Villain plans to establish a false (or perhaps even real) claim to power based on the leader’s
family tree (as opposed to the villain’s). Supposedly, leader’s ancestor was adopted and named as the heir, while villain’s real or
purported ancestor actually had the right by primogeniture. Or vice versa. This is probably done with forged documents.

42

False Defense – Leader’s Base. The villain will stage an attack on a superior officer’s base of power, and be in the right place
at the right time to “defend” it from his own attack (the fight might be staged, or might be real), and thereby earn his superior
officer’s gratitude.

43

False Defense – Leader’s Family. The villain will stage an attack on a superior officer’s family, and be in the right place at the
right time to “defend” the family from the attack, thereby earning the superior officer’s gratitude.

44

False Defense – Leader’s Home Community. The villain will stage an attack on a superior officer’s home community while the
leader is away, placing himself in the right place at the right time to “defend” it from his own attack. He hopes to gain the leader’s
gratitude from the successful defense.

45

False Identity – Higher Authority (minion). Villain’s minion is posing as the representative of a higher authority (religious,
feudal, etc) and is delivering “orders” to the leader. The imposture could be accomplished with shapechanging, forged documents,
or sheer bravado.

46

False Identity – Higher Authority (villain). The villain is posing as the representative of a higher authority (religious, feudal,
etc) and is delivering “orders” to the leader. The imposture could be accomplished with shapechanging, forged documents, or
sheer bravado.

47

Financial Scheme – Debt and Foreclosure. The villain plans to put a rival into monetary debt to the villain. This could be done
by a combination of financial scams and with the help of moneylenders who are a front for the villain. He might also be buying
the rival’s debts from moneylenders. Foreclosure or gaining influence through the threat of foreclosure might be the leverage he
plans to achieve.

48

Financial Scheme – Identity Theft. The villain is trying to create a financial disaster for one of his rivals, such as an equal rival,
a superior officer, or even the top leader in the chain of command. His method is to use the opponent’s identity to borrow money
and incur debts in the opponent’s name. The villain, of course, benefits twice: he not only eliminates his rival, but also he gets the
fraudulently obtained cash.

49

Financial Scheme – Scams. The villain is trying to create a financial disaster for one of his rivals by targeting them directly with
financial scams. Probably the villain is trying to pocket the money from the scams, too.

50

Financial Scheme – Theft. The villain is trying to create a financial disaster for one of his rivals by stealing the rival’s money.

51

Impersonation – Heir. The villain plans to pose as a lost or missing heir (possibly one that became lost or missing through the
villain’s efforts).

52

Impersonation – Shapechanging. The villain is using shapechanging of some kind to impersonate a kidnapped rival, or even the
leader of the organization.

53

Infiltration – Mental. Villain is in control of guards or other military force, and is corrupting their minds with charm, hypnosis,
unbelievable charisma, etc. His goal is to use them as the shock troops for some sort of coup attempt.

54

Infiltration – Purge. The villain is (or has been) infiltrating troops, monsters, etc. into the community where the organization is
based, planning for a sudden and coordinated purge of his rivals.

55

Infiltration – Takeover. The villain is (or has been) infiltrating troops, monsters, etc. into the community where the organization
is based, planning for a sudden and coordinated takeover of key locations.

56

Kidnap Rival. The villain seeks to kidnap a rival. The goal is to get information, get the hostage to write letters that help the
villain, etc.

57

Kidnap Rival’s Family. The villain seeks to take a rival’s family or friends hostage to influence the rival’s actions.

58

Manipulate Omens Against Rival. The villain plans to manipulate omens to suggest that his rival is evil or unsuitable for
command.

59

Manipulate Omens for Self. The villain plans to manipulate omens to suggest that he (or his minion) is the best choice for
something, the rightful leader, the only hope, etc.

60

Marry Heir – Magical Domination. The villain plans to seduce the top leader’s daughter (or son, as applicable) by using charm,
hypnotism, love potions, etc. This part of the plot may already have occurred, putting the player characters into the position of
having to stop the marriage or otherwise foil the plot.

61

Marry Heir – Seduction. The villain plans to gain the position of heir to political power by marrying one of the leader’s children.
The villain is using traditional means to do so (presumably this is a villain with tremendous charisma).

43

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Die Roll

Method (d100)

62

Military Conquest. The villain has (or is building) enough military power (outside the community) to make a direct military
conquest. This is fairly straightforward.

63

Military Interdiction. The villain is using military power to cut off supplies or exports – this is the classic brigand-villain who
starves his enemies into submission and is given power when they surrender. In a more abstract sense, a sinister merchant could
use a financial version of this scheme against a guild or another merchant, using thieves, bandits, and pirates to stop their exports
and trade.

64

Military Intimidation. The villain is building up a military force inside or outside the organization/community, planning to reach
the point where his military power is enough to allow him to influence policy.

65

Military Takeover – Circumventing Defenses. The villain has military power of his own, but his real project is to circumvent the
target’s defenses. In the case of a fortification, this could include digging a secret tunnel beneath the walls; in other cases, it could
be a preparation to poison or incapacitate defenders, hire a traitor to open the gates, etc.

66

Military Takeover – Removing Key People. The villain has military power and is ready to attack. His first step is to remove a
few key people of power who represent a military threat to him. Note: in addition to controlling a government, this plot could also
be applied to the takeover of a guild by means of a purge – the strongest guild members and their adventurer friends might be the
targets of the purge.

67

Military Takeover – Stealing Key. The villain has military power, but is working on weakening the defenses of the target. His
immediate method is to steal a key or password that gives him access to the defensive item. The item might be magical, or it might
be, say, the password that lets people into the area where the catapults are located (so that they can be sabotaged just before the
attack).

68

Military Takeover – War of Attrition. The villain has military power, but is working on weakening the defenses of his target by
ambushing enemy soldiers or guards before the actual assault, thus reducing their numbers.

69

Minion Seduces Heir. The villain has a minion or an ally who is seducing the heir. The minion could possibly be a supernatural
creature, such as a succubus.

70

Mob Charisma. By sheer force of charisma, the villain is whipping the population into a frenzy, preparing to mount a popular
takeover in a series of riots.

71

Murder Own Powerful Spouse. The villain is married to the leader already, who is now his only impediment to absolute power.

72

Murder Threats. Villain threatens to kill people in the general population one day at a time until the leader surrenders control.
Unless he is acting with a secret identity, the villain is either very powerful or very insane to think he can hold onto power after
taking it this way – but perhaps he’s right. If he is not acting with a secret identity, he likely has a hidden stronghold to protect
himself from attempts to stop him.

73

Overt Curse for Control. Villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a member of the leader’s family.
Everyone knows that the villain created the curse. The villain will only remove the curse if the leader steps down in favor of the
villain.

74

Party Misdirected. The “villain” is the good guy, and the leader is the bad guy, but this is not clear at the outset of the adventure.

75

Pied Piper Strategy – Heirship. The villain controls monsters or predators that are attacking everywhere in the general
population. The villain offers to get rid of them if he is made the leader’s heir (he probably won’t reveal that he started the
problem in the first place).

76

Pied Piper Strategy – Position of Authority. The villain controls monsters or predators that are attacking everywhere in the
general population. The villain offers to get rid of them if he is given a particular position of authority (he probably won’t reveal
that he started the problem in the first place).

77

Pied Piper Strategy – Marry Heir. The villain controls monsters or predators that are attacking everywhere in the general
population. The villain offers to get rid of them if he is allowed to marry the leader’s heir (he probably won’t reveal that he started
the problem in the first place).

78

Pied Piper Strategy – Total Control. The villain controls monsters or predators that are attacking everywhere in the general
population. The villain offers to get rid of them if he is given control (he probably won’t reveal that he started the problem in the
first place).

79

Prepared Purge. The villain is working on assembling all of his rivals into a specific, vulnerable location for a single, decisive
strike. As the foundation for an adventure, the characters might have been hired as security for the event, as a bodyguard, or
might stumble onto the plot before the strike takes place. Conversely, this plot could be used as a back story to explain why the
characters have just entered a community thrown into chaos by a successful purge.

80

Prosecute Rivals. The villain is in control of the police, or has the power to prosecute crimes. He is using this power to eliminate
his rivals, investigating them or charging them with crimes.

81

Replace Key Leaders. The villain is replacing key members of the population with shapeshifting minions who will support him
when he makes his bid for power.

82

Rig Election for Ally. The villain is rigging an election to get a friend or ally elected into a position of power. The position might
be a village alderman, the chancellor of the exchequer, judge, master of the revels, etc.

83

Rig Election for Minion. The villain is rigging an election to get one of his minions elected to a position of power.

84

Rig Election for Self. The villain is rigging an election to get himself elected into a position of power.

Method (d100)

85

Rig Vote Against Rival – Financial. The villain is rigging a vote in favor of a law that will create problems for a rival if the law
is passed – it will create oppressive taxes on the rival’s (but not the villain’s) main source of income, as one example.

86

Rig Vote Against Rival – Status and Standing. The villain is rigging a vote in favor of a law that will create problems for a rival
if the law is passed. It will make the rival ineligible to hold his current office. Examples include votes that discriminate on the
basis of race or gender, require minimum financial resources, require that the office holder has never been arrested for drunkenness,
etc.

87

Secret Curse for Heirship. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a member of the leader’s
family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the curse if he is declared the rightful heir to
power. This is very similar to the Pied Piper strategy.

88

Secret Curse for Position of Authority. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a member of the
leader’s family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the curse if he is granted a position of
authority (possibly a very minor one).

89

Secret Curse for Total Control. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a member of the leader’s
family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the curse if he is acclaimed as the new leader
(this is unlikely to work if the target is a governmental organization but might work very well in a financial organization such as a
guild).

90

Secret Curse to Marry Heir. The villain has cursed the leader, one of the leader’s main followers, or a member of the leader’s
family. It is not known who created the curse, but the villain will offer to remove the curse if he is allowed to marry the heiress.

91

Seize Key Location and Interdict. The villain plans to seize a stronghold that controls supply or access to the targeted area,
whereupon he will simply demand that the current leader surrender power. This is a preparation for a Military Interdiction,
although the key feature is to improve that gambit with possession of the stronghold.

92

Sends Anti-Rival Dreams. The villain has the ability to influence another person’s dreams, and is broadcasting them to suggest
that his rival is a bad person or otherwise unsuitable. The method used might be a magic item, a minion with this supernatural
ability, or possibly influencing dreams in one of the villain’s own inherent powers.

93

Send Pro-Villain Dreams. The villain has the ability to influence another person’s dreams, and is broadcasting them to suggest
that he or his minion should be in charge. The method used might be a magic item, a minion with this supernatural ability, or
possibly influencing dreams in one of the villain’s own inherent powers.

94

Take Symbol of Authority. The villain is trying to take control of a particular symbol of authority (a crown, scepter, etc) that
actually conveys the authority he seeks. This might be a tradition that has expired, but which could still be a big problem for the
existing leader. As an example: “Whosoever holds the Sword of Karnak is the rightful king of Karnakland…”

95

Threat to Unleash Catastrophe. The villain has set things up (and must be able to prove it) so that he can unleash a catastrophe.
Unless the leader surrenders control by a specific time, the villain will cause the catastrophe to take place.

96

Threaten Food Shortage. The villain controls the area’s food supply, and threatens to cut it off if he is not granted a position of
authority. Note that this might be a permissible and legal threat if the villain is a baron who supplies a town with food – or it might
be completely illegal if the villain is an orcish chief who has conquered the nearby countryside.

97

Threaten Labor Shortage. Villain is in enough of a position of economic power that he can cause a guild or group of laborers to
go on strike unless the villain is granted more power. Note that the villain can reverse the appearance of this plot, too, by creating
a situation where the strike looks inevitable unless the villain steps in to solve it.

98

Undermine Leader’s Credibility. Villain is trying to undermine the leader’s credibility by spreading rumors and lies indicating
that the leader is not the legitimate ruler, or that he is incompetent. Presumably, the villain has a way of stepping into power if the
leader is removed.

99

Use Fall Guys. The villain is insinuating himself into the leader’s confidence by setting up dupes to oppose the leader – then
giving information about their activities to him. The fall guys are either set up anonymously, or they were hired directly by the
villain – in which case they have to die in order for the villain’s plan to remain under cover. A survivor would pose a serious
problem for the villain if the survivor knows of the villain’s involvement. Player characters might get hired as the dupes…

100

Weaken Rival – Destroy Base. The villain is trying to destroy a community that forms the base of his rival’s economic or
political power. For example, if the rival is a feudal baron, the villain might be targeting the rivals fief or fiefdoms.

Apogee and
Perigee (solar,
lunar, or other)

Perigee is the closest point in the orbit of two celestial objects, and Apogee is the farthest point. Obviously,
the orbit has to be elliptical, not circular, in order to have closer and farther points in the orbit. Keep in mind
that this near-far relationship could exist between all kinds of celestial objects, not just suns and moons.
Comet cycles are based on apogees and perigees, meteors move around with apogees and perigees, and even
magical structures could have such a relationship to each other. Magical objects on the earth might activate
only when a sun or moon is close; or perhaps the magical objects are huge metal blocks placed in the sky by
some forgotten, ancient race, designed for some inscrutable burpose…

Calendar Cycles

Many cultures group years into a repeating cycle, treating different years much as Western culture interpreted
the zodiacal segments of a single year. The Chinese Calendar, for example, follows a cycle of the Year of
the Rat, Year of the Ox, Year of the Tiger, Year of the Rabbit, Year of the Dragon, Year of the Snake, Year of
the Horse, Year of the Goat, Year of the Monkey, Year of the Rooster, Year of the Dog, and Year of the Boar.
Certain characteristics are attributed to people born in the different years.

Celestial Cycles

The zodiac is a division of the sky into twelve regions, each called a “house.” The regions are: Aries, Taurus,
Gemini, Cancer, Leo, Virgo, Libra, Scorpio, Sagittarius, Capricorn, Aquarius, and Pisces. Each house is
associated with behaviors and with a particular metaphorical emblem. A fantasy world might have different
zodiacal signs, or a different method of interpreting the movements of the stars. The zodiac is linked to the
solar year, not the lunar year.

16-20

Comet Cycles

The appearance of certain predictable comets in the night sky is often given mystical significance. Cometcycles can be a great adventure-generating device because of the long intervals between the comet’s
appearances. Lots of unpredictable things can happen to places, societies, and collective memory while the
comet is away. For example: if some form of lycanthropy is linked to the appearance of a comet rather than
a full moon, the lycanthropic disease might be transmitted far and wide while dormant, then suddenly appear
all over the place when the comet appears in the sky. It would become a sort of celestial retro-virus.

21-25

Device-Driven
Cycle

A cycle might be derived from the operation of a device that divides time into a regular or irregular pattern.
For instance, if the cycle is determined by the burning of candles without regard to the length of the candle,
the cycle would be irregular. If the candles were scrupulously measured to be identical, the candle-driven
cycle would be regular. Devices to measure out time could involve dripping water, candles, hourglasses,
water wheels, gears, and many other mechanical arrangements.

Equinox and
Solstice (solar
cycle)

A solstice is one of the two times of year when the sun is farthest off the celestial equator. These occur at
approximately June 22 (the summer solstice) and December 22 (the winter solstice). Summer solstice is the
shortest night of the year, and winter solstice is the longest night. The equinox is when the sun crosses the
equator and days and nights are of closest to equal length. The equinoxes occur at approximately March
21 (the Vernal Equinox, also the first day of Spring) and September 23 (the Autumnal Equinox). Note that
Autumn and Spring are reversed for the northern and southern hemispheres of the earth.

Fashion Cycles

The types of clothes and the jewelry people wear comes into and out of fashion periodically, as do haircuts,
luxury commodities, philosophies, and religious practices. Magical effects like planar gates could easily be
influenced by fashions in behavior or religion. It might be, for example, that a planar gate opens only when
a local god has a minimum number of worshippers present at a significant ritual. When it becomes more
fashionable for people to worship that god, the chance of the gate opening would suddenly increase.

Freezing/Thawing
Cycle

A particular cycle for a villain’s activities, or the opening of some sort of portal or dungeon entrance, could
be linked to the seasonal freezing and thawing of a barrier that blocks the portal, or of a mechanism that
controls it. The builder might have intended the cycle of freezing and thawing, or the seasons might have
changed since the original construction. Freezing and thawing also affect the volume of water moving in
rivers, and patterns of migration by animals. This is a time cycle that can be used to drive a wide variety of
adventures and monsters.

Lunar Cycle

Earth’s lunar cycle from new moon to new moon is 29.5 days, and is called the Synodic Lunar Cycle.
Measuring the lunar cycle based on when the moon arrives in the same place in the sky (regardless of phase)
is called the Sidereal Cycle and is 27.1 days in length. For gaming purposes, the “average” lunar cycle of 28
days is probably close enough unless the adventure is deeply involved in astrology. The phases of the moon
are: new moon, crescent moon, first quarter moon, waxing gibbous moon, full moon, waning gibbous moon,
last quarter moon, crescent moon, and then new moon again. The cycle of lunar eclipses is also an excellent
fantasy theme, although the cycle of an eclipse is much longer than the cycle of the lunar phases.

Morphological
Life Cycle (one
creature)

Some creatures have a life cycle in which their form changes radically; butterflies begin as caterpillars, frogs
begin as tadpoles, many insects go through a pupae or larval stage. Although this is related to the reproductive
cycle of the species, the radical morphological changes allow these creatures to have the right body-form for
the right purpose at the right time. The caterpillar form, for example, is well adapted to eating huge quantities
of food, whereas the mobility of the butterfly stage allows for finding stronger mates more easily. Intelligent
creatures with morphological cycles might open and close portals (or be able to, based on their current phase).
For example, a gate might remain closed while eggs gestate in some bizarre inter-dimensional space, or be
opened when the creatures are in a predatory body-form and then close again. Only the strong and well fed
predators would make it back to the gate, and would then be all together within the gate for the mating cycle to
begin. The possible variations on this pattern are quite numerous. If a villain is acting according to such a life
cycle, it’s not necessarily because the villain is one of the morphologically shifting creatures. It might be that
the villain knows how to take advantage of the changing life forms of the creatures, or that he’s allied to them
but can only take advantage of the alliance when the creatures are in an intelligent form, a dangerous form, a
magically powerful form, or what have you. Again, the possibilities are vast.

Morphological
Life Cycle (series
of creatures)

Just as a particular life form may go through radical morphological changes in order to link up form with
function in a series of steps, it is also possible for a species to generate a sequence of life forms, only one of
which is the breeder. As an example, envision a life form whose “queen” and “drone” eggs stay dormant for a
long period of time, and need to be shifted from a hot incubation environment to a colder hatching environment.
One “generation” of workers is a hot-weather creature that cares for the eggs during the incubation phase. As
the incubation phase ends, the worker mate among themselves, producing an entirely different form – a flying
form well suited for migration. The flying forms transport the eggs to a colder climate in a migration, breed
again to create a cold-weather worker caste, and then die. The cold-weather caste hatches rapidly in the cold,
and these workers care for the queen and drone eggs. The queens and drones fly back to the hot-weather area
to breed and lay eggs of three kinds: queens, drones, and more hot-weather workers. The hot-weather workers
hatch quickly to care for the new queen and drone eggs, and the cycle begins again. At some point in such a
cycle, it might be that the door to underground hatching chambers must be unsealed, or the migration might
take place across different planes of existence, requiring the temporary opening of planar gates. A villain’s
motivation in all this could be of many different kinds: he might be intercepting the migrations, stealing eggs,
using the unique capabilities of one of the life forms in an alliance, etc.

Planetary Cycles

The proximity of particular planets to the Earth, or their location within a region of the sky (particularly a
zodiacal region) can be a usable cycle for the purposes of a fantasy world, possibly having effects on magic,
on different kinds of magic, villain motivations, and the opening or closing of planar gates or dungeon
entrances.

Reproductive
Cycle

The average human menstrual cycle is 28 days. If the villainess is non-human, the cycle might not be a
menstrual cycle, but a cycle of being “in heat” or “in season.” This same pattern might apply to unusual
monsters as well as non-human animals. Female dogs stay in heat for about 21-28 days depending on breed
(as one example of a heat cycle). Note: the cycle of a male villain’s activity might be linked to someone else’s
reproductive cycle. The purpose of a dungeon or planar gate that opens and seals based on the reproductive
cycle of a tribe or being is fairly obvious, and could (ahem) give birth to interesting adventure scenarios.

Rising and Falling
Magical Power

The lunar, menstrual, and solar cycles are all associated with the rise and fall of magical capabilities, but a
fantasy world may have an independent cycle of rising a falling magical power, not marked by these factors.
Fluctuations in magic power might be druidic (some fluctuation in the earth’s spiritual nature), might be
related to arcane magic (a fluctuation in the eldritch energy that can be tapped by spells) or might be related
to a fluctuation in divine power (possibly related to planar “distance, a period of dormancy, or divine battles
that occupy the attention of the gods from time to time). A wizard’s personal capability might be linked to
the concept of “mana,” personal reserves of magical power that might shift with the tides of time. Monsters
might also feel the effects of magical change.

Scriptural Cycle

In Judaism, the Torah (that’s the five books of Moses, in case you’re not familiar) is divided into parshas
(segments) one of which is read and studied each seven days. The parshas correspond to the Jewish lunar
calendar, so that the same parsha is read at the same lunar date every year. The point of completion of the
reading, when the Torah scroll is rolled back to the beginning is a major holiday, as is the middle of the Torah
(the day of atonement) and the reading on the new year (which precedes the day of atonement by a week).
A religious scripture in a fantasy world might also follow a cycle not related to the calendar – planar gates
or subterranean chambers might be opened (or open of their own accord) in a cycle driven by the reading
of scriptures instead of a calendar cycle. The reading itself might trigger these events, rather than merely
corresponding to them.

Secondary Effect
Cycle

Any of the various cycles listed in this table might be the cause of some other secondary effect that normally
(but does not always) result from the primary cycle. For instance, the hatching patterns of locusts often
(but does not always) cause famines. The focus of your adventure might not be the locust hatching, but the
resulting famine. The periodic flooding of the Nile river was necessary to good harvests in Ancient Egypt;
when that cycle failed due to low rainfall in the African interior, famines and food shortages resulted in
Egypt. Adventures premised upon the secondary effects of a primary cycle might focus on the times when
the expected result (the flooding of the Nile, or a locust plague) doesn’t take place. Why didn’t it? The
answer might be valuable, crucial, or financially rewarding.

91-95

Temperature
Cycles

Variations in temperature can cause all sorts of varying human behaviors, cause changes in economic factors,
and can also trigger certain events in the animal and plant kingdoms. Consider such things as a locust-like
insect with eggs that lie dormant until particularly hot temperatures arrive. In a completely different sort
of example, consider than a villain’s opportunities for villainy might be considerably enhanced if the local
community is snowbound, huddled up in cottages instead of wandering about the village with prying eyes
that might see what he’s doing…

96-00

Traumatic Stress
Cycle

Individuals who have suffered traumatic stress may re-live the event or its emotional impact, and this often
happens on or around the anniversary of the event. The cycle could also be based on any cycle of events that
either symbolize or reproduce the conditions and setting of the traumatic event. A fantasy world might have
an analogue, in other words, to the way many War veterans react to the sound of helicopters and/or fireworks.

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Unusual Minions and Lieutenants
Many of the above tables involve a villain’s minions. An adventure is usually improved by having some of these minions be unusual in some
respect. In particular, if the villain has an interesting minion, the nature of the minion can generate some interesting ideas about the villain’s plot.
This might seem backward, but creating an adventure isn’t always a linear process. Ideas about “later” parts, or little details, can sometimes
generate fantastic ideas for the adventure’s overall structure.

BOOK ONE: PRINCIPLES AND STARTING POINTS — THE VILLAIN’S PLAN

Concluding Remarks to Book One
As mentioned in the Introduction, the tables in this book are for top-down adventure creation, for referees who prefer to have the adventure’s
backbone in place before messing about with the details. Later books will provide the meat and potatoes for referees who prefer to build outward
from evocative details, fitting the backbone into the details rather than vice versa. Never be afraid to go back and change even the fundamental
premises of an adventure if your later ideas cause it to evolve in a new direction. Writing an adventure is not a linear process, and creativity is
not an orderly process. It’s more like a jigsaw puzzle – there’s no predicting which parts of the puzzle will start coming together until you start.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Introduction to Book Two
This second book of the series focuses on monsters – mainly on creating new ones for use in an adventure. Monsters aren’t quite the “top level”
of adventure design, like locations and missions, but sometimes they are the primary and driving force behind the creation of an adventure, giving
rise to the location or the mission instead of vice versa. I can think of many of my own adventures that were sparked by monsters, and when I’m
beginning the adventure creation process I often look for ideas by paging through monster books. Like the first book in this series, the objective
is not to provide on-the-fly tables for quick use. There are other monster-generation books which already do this quite well. Instead, this book is
designed to tap a deeper creative wellspring – which can be hard when you’re under time pressure with players tossing potato chips at you and
asking if you’re ready to start. The book can be used for on-the-fly ideas, but to use it at full power, so to speak, it works best ahead of time. It’s
a doubly powerful tool when used in conjunction with the first book of the series, but it absolutely isn’t necessary to have the first book in order
to use this one.

Monsters Generally
One of the best ways to come up with the idea for an adventure is to start with a monster, or combination of monsters, and work from there.
And if you’re lucky enough to get the sudden inspiration for a brand new monster, often the adventure will write itself from there almost without
further effort.
Good monsters are more than just an agglomeration of statistics and abilities thrown together. In many cases, what you need to create a monster
(especially if it is supposed to inspire an adventure) is some other detail besides or in addition to the monster’s combat profile. In many cases,
those additional details can define a combat profile much better than the brute-force method of generating trial-and-error combinations over and
over again.
This Book is divided into two main parts: (1) generating monsters by specific type (undead, etc.), and (2) a set of general tables. The general
tables can also be used as a starting point, beginning with the monster’s Combat Profile, but this method calls for slightly larger creative leaps
than starting with the type. Most of the details generated from the monster type tables will refer the designer to one or more of the general tables
in the second section.

*The definition of each type is contained at
the beginning of each section.

Beasts
A beast is a monster that lives in the fantasy world’s natural ecosystem. It probably isn’t more
intelligent than a regular animal, although it might be unusually cunning. Giant ants and griffons are
both examples of this sort of monster. If your adventure requires an interesting roving predator, or an
infestation of bizarre creatures, this is probably the category you’ll want to use as a starting point to
generate some ideas.
Step 1: Get a Starter Image of the Body Form. Roll on the Creature Attributes Table (2-2) for a
basic body form. You’re not locked into this body form, but I have always found it easiest to come up
with interesting details when I’ve got a vague picture of the monster already in mind. Sometimes the
details are interesting enough to warrant changing the whole concept retroactively to fit them. If that
happens, I consider it a perfect result.
Step 2: Mix Attributes of Two Creatures. Roll twice on the Creature Attributes Table (2-2). Take an
attribute from the first creature (any attribute, your choice) and mix it with an attribute from the second
creatures (again, your choice). Let’s say that you started with a Cheetah’s body form, and then rolled
12 (Beetle) and 16 (Canary). One possibility is to say that you’ve got a cat-like predator with a beetle’s
exoskeleton that has bright, canary-like coloration. Another possibility is to say that you’ve got a giant
beetle that chases down its prey like a cheetah and kills it with a sharp beak (canary). A third possibility
is to discard the cheetah (that was just a starting point) and create a beetle that sings sweetly to draw its
prey close for the kill (presumably with a saving throw to avoid the effects of the song).
Step 3: Fill in the Details. Roll for Special Attacks (Tables 2-78 and 2-79), Special Defenses and
Abilities (Table 2-82) and Distinctive Attributes (Table 2-83). Tie those results into the Creature Attributes
you’ve already generated, or treat the results as new features to add into the monster’s description. Beast
monsters are usually pretty simple, so you will probably need to discard the results from Table 2-79 or
2-82 unless they happen to generate something excellent.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Constructs
Constructs are man-made objects that have at least rudimentary intelligence, and probably can also move. As such, they share enough
characteristics that it makes sense to lump them together for creative ideas, but as monsters these types can be quite different – some of them are
animated by a spirit, some of them have magically-implanted intelligence, some might only follow orders, and some of them might have some sort
of machine-intelligence. Obviously, these different origins will tend to fit into radically different types of adventure settings and in the service of
radically different villains (if, indeed, they are still in anyone’s service at all once the adventurers encounter them). It’s worth mentioning that the
folkloric theme of a created monster getting out of control is a very, very, common one.

Elementalanimated or
spirit-animated
machine or
object

An elemental creature or a creature from the spirit-world has been bound into
the object, machine, or structure as the force that animates it. The imprisoned/
bound creature provides the object with whatever intelligence or cunning it
possesses.

Animated chairs, tables, catapults, etc.

41-60

Magically
Augmented
Machine

A machine that doesn’t operate purely by means of technology, and may not
include any mechanical components at all other than hinges and bolts. A
basic example is an iron cobra with no inner mechanisms – it is an object
specifically designed to be animated. On the more complex side of the
spectrum might be a huge lobster-shaped battle robot powered by magical
pistons and gears, but with no magic animating the mechanisms driven by
those pistons and gears.

61-80

Spirit-animated
substance, in a
prepared shape

This includes the classic man-shaped golem, but could be any shape. A spirit
could be imprisoned in a garbage pile, and then you’d have an animated
garbage-pile.

81-00

True Machine

This is either a machine with some sort of artificial brain, or a machine with
no intelligence whatsoever.

Table 2-8: Physical Danger Posed by Construct
It’s easiest to start creating a construct by focusing on what sort of risk
it poses to the adventurers. This list of physical dangers constructs can
cause is more focused than the larger tables of physical attacks (Table
2-72), and may be a better starting point. After getting a general picture
of the construct’s physical threat, and if the construct is more than just a
physical monster, roll on the large table of special attacks (Table 2-79).
If you don’t get a good mental picture just from Table 2-79, use Table
2-78 for an idea about how the Special Attack might be employed.

Table 2-9: Modern Analogues for Fantasy Devices

Table 2-10: Reason for Creating Construct

Another way of getting ideas for constructs is to let your mind wander
through the realm of existing modern machines. I don’t use this table
much for generating a construct directly, but it has worked very well if I
think of this as the room where a construct is located, and then thinking
about the construct as being a component of that room or the room’s
purpose.

The creator’s purpose for building the construct can give you ideas for
what the construct does. This table is my favorite way to get ideas for
the more unusual constructs, especially where the primary threat might
not be physical damage.

Yet another way to generate ideas for constructs is to get a mental

Take note that the table heading says “reminiscent of.” It’s best to
create only a blurry mental picture for dreaming these up, and let your
subconscious take over from there.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES
Table 2-12: Construct’s Loss of Control

Die Roll

One feature of constructs in folklore is the potential for them to go
out of the creator’s control. Consider Walt Disney’s The Sorcerer’s
Apprentice and Mary Shelley’s Frankenstein as examples. Many
versions of the original golem folktale (in which the golem is created
by a Cabbalist rabbi to protect the Jews of Prague from a pogrom)
also include the golem’s attempt to remain “alive” once its purpose is
served. In general, this theme is more applicable to constructs that are
animated by an imprisoned or summoned spirit rather than those which
are purely mechanisms or magically-augmented medieval technology.
Not every construct should be subject to loss of control, or the theme
becomes a bit overused.

01-10

Base percentage chance checked during each combat
round (but not increasing)

11-20

Base percentage chance that depends on the construct’s
age (would differ for each individual monster but not
change during the encounter)

Base percentage chance under certain circumstances

31-40

Base percentage chance when confused in some way

41-50

Base percentage chance when given a command

51-60

Base percentage chance when hit with particular magic

61-70

Construct begins as inactive (out of control) but
automatically “activates” into control based on certain
actions it observes

71-80

Construct begins as inactive (out of control) but has
cumulative increasing chance of “activating” into
control under certain circumstances

81-90

Construct’s loss of control (by whatever method) results
in the escape of its activating spirit to possess a person

91-00

Cumulative increasing chance during combat

Type of Loss of Control

Draconic
Draconic creatures include not only dragons, but wyverns and other dragon-like beasts. The difficulty with generating unusual body forms for
dragons is that if you get too far away from the basic lizard-like reptile with bat wings, you start to get something that isn’t really a dragon any
more. Therefore, these tables focus on three components of a dragon or draconic monster: a single unusual physical feature, a single unusual ability
(with a sub-table for breath weapons), and the dragon’s mentality.

Theme: don’t touch it. The dragon’s skin is adhesive or corrosive.

13-16

Sucks blood, might have other bat-like features including echolocation

17-20

Lives underwater as easily as on land. Might have fish-like features such as extra fins

21-24

Sings beautifully (and probably dangerously). This might be in a human-type voice, or it might be trilling or whistling.

25-28

Theme: Perceptive. The dragon has unusual powers of perception that give it an advantage in combat. In general, it will either be
able to predict how it’s going to be attacked (defensive) or find weaknesses in the opponents (leading to some sort of attack bonus).
The nature of the perception might give the dragon other benefits for things like avoiding being taken by surprise. The actual
mechanism could include ESP, smell, high intelligence, or precognition.

29-32

Theme: Illusion. The dragon can change the perceptions of its opponents. The source might be to magically produce visual
illusions, or to use some sort of magical mind domination.

33-36

Theme: Hidden. The dragon can conceal itself, camouflage itself, or hide in unexpected places for an ambush (under water, in
shadows, in walls, on ceilings, etc)

37-40

Theme: Don’t hurt it (acidic blood, corrosive surface, or other downside to using physical attacks). This is similar to the “don’t
touch it” theme, but the effect only kicks in if the dragon is physically damaged. This could also include reflecting spells,
transferring damage to another, or being healed by certain types of attacks.

41-44

Theme: Spellcaster. The dragon casts spells, casts spells more powerfully than expected, or casts a wider variety of spells than one
might expect. Alternatively, the dragon might simply have an array of natural abilities that mimic spells.

communication to do so (song, trilling, mental telepathy, soothing voice, persuasion, etc).

Unusual breath weapon

Unusual Breath Weapon
Unusual breath weapons don’t figure prominently in the unusual abilities table above, which is designed to focus on sparking the designer’s
higher creativity. However, for a dragon that’s simply a slight deviation from the norm, a variant breath weapon is often all that’s needed – breath
weapons, after all, are probably the most defining feature of dragons. If you want your dragon to breathe fire, poison gas, electricity (lightning),
acid, or frost, but in a different way than normal, don’t roll on the first column – just roll on the second.

effect.

Long wisp forms into a line perpendicular to the direction in which it
was exhaled, possibly striking several opponents in a front rank (but
with a short range in terms of the distance it travels from the dragon).

41-44

Sleep or lethargy

Narrow line, glob, or other substance aimed at single opponent (spit,
basically)

45-48

Narrow line, glob, or other substance aimed at single opponent (spit,
basically)

49-52

Pushes, pulls, raises, moves, teleports, or levitates, as
applicable.

Not a breath weapon at all, but a “sound” weapon produced by the
dragon’s voice, song, or roar. (determine range and possibly shape –
probably a cone – as you choose)

53-56

Affects memory

Not a breath weapon at all, but a blast from the dragon itself in all
directions up to a certain range. This might be a mental blast, or might be
accomplished by shaking out dust, tiny eggs, or sweat (like a dog shakes
off water).

57-60

Corrosive to metal, wood, and/or leather

Not a breath weapon at all, but a gaze weapon (or even “rays” from the
dragon’s eyes). Usually targeted at a single individual.

61-64

Commands, charms, renders open to suggestion,
confuses, or mentally influences

Not a breath weapon at all, but an effect that surrounds the dragon at all
times, due to smell, flames, cloud, vermin on skin, etc).

65-68

Transforms, shape-changes, changes size, or changes
state of matter (into liquid or into stone, for example)

Not a breath weapon at all; effect is caused by dragon’s concentration
upon an opponent or an area.

69-72

Removes one or more senses: blindness, hearing, or
all senses. Alternatively, it causes “malfunctions” or
imperfections with these senses.

Roll again to determine the shape or delivery of the breath weapon; but
whatever effect it inflicts, it adheres or lingers in such a way that it gets
several chances to cause a failed saving throw or otherwise affect those
who escaped its effects when it first manifested.

73-76

Adhesive (glue-like)

Slow-moving floating globule, cloud, or bubble.

77-80

Hypnotic

Smaller cloud, affecting area in front of dragon

81-84

Temporarily lowers attribute score: strength,
intelligence, etc. The effect might be defined, or the
effects might simply be whatever the rules define for
the lower attribute score.

Smaller cloud, affecting area in front of dragon

85-88

Twitching, dancing, or convulsions.

Spits out a grenade-like solid, which explodes to deliver the special
effect in a radius. Might or might not have perfect aim.

89-92

Nausea

Vomited liquid, probably a short cone-shape

93-96

Paralysis

Wide linear blast of breath, filling a narrow but rectangular area in front
of the dragon (affects all within)

97-00

Imprisons (dimensional, quick-setting resin, ice
forming, stone-forming, etc)

Wide linear blast of breath, filling a narrow but rectangular area in front
of the dragon (affects all within). Probably no more than 5 to 10ft wide,
with whatever length seems appropriate.

65

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES
Table 2-16: Individual Dragon’s Mentalities, Motivations, and Status
Die Roll

Mentality, Motivation, or Status

01-05

Arcane. Whether or not the dragon is a good spell caster, it knows a great deal of useful arcane lore it has accumulated over the
years. It might even have human magic-user followers, who seek to gain the bits of knowledge it occasionally provides to them.

06-10

Assembling Followers. Followers, for this purpose, include a set of young or baby dragons, or a group of fanatical worshippers, or
an army of mercenaries, or even something stranger like a collection of trained slimes or a trained pack of giant lizards.

11-15

Collector. The dragon hoards a particular type of item. Some of these might be relatively innocuous, such as musical instruments.
On the other hand, a dragon who collects human skulls is possibly a big problem.

16-20

Connoisseur. The dragon constantly seeks a supply of something with a particular taste or quality. This might range from maidens
to fine wines.

21-25

Constrained to Action. The dragon is forced, either through its nature or due to magic, to respond in certain ways to certain stimuli.
Examples of this include: not being able to tell a lie, required to grant a wish if defeated in combat, required to hunt down a
particular individual, required to guard a certain object, etc.

26-30

Damsel-Kidnapper. Pretty standard.

31-35

Demonic. As with many Christian dragon-stories of the middle ages, the dragon is actually the servant of a supernatural evil power
rather than just a preternatural creature. Dragons that are a form of demon might have a demon master nearby, or one that can be
summoned. Alternatively, the dragon might be able to summon lesser demons of some kind into its service. This sort of dragon
would be considerably more sinister than a regular dragon, but not necessarily much more intelligent.

36-40

Enslaved. The dragon is subservient to, enchanted by, subdued by, or sworn to another being. For a folkloric type of dragon, it
might be in love with a human maiden or controlled by some other creature weaker than the dragon itself. Not likely, though.

41-45

Envoy or Scout. The dragon is exploring or negotiating on behalf of some other villain elsewhere. The questions to be resolved are:
(1) on whose behalf is the dragon negotiating, and (2) with whom is the dragon negotiating, monsters or humans?

46-50

Foreigner. The dragon comes from a different place, either because it has a nomadic personality or because it was chased out. It is
likely working on establishing a new lair.

51-55

Hide. The dragon is virtually obsessed with keeping itself hidden from human notice (or perhaps from the notice of a stronger
dragon, or other enemy or threat). This might be due to caution, might be a younger dragon’s strategy for getting older and bigger,
or might just be due to cowardice.

56-60

Imprisoned. The dragon is in some way confined to an area, either because the exit isn’t large enough, or because it is scared to
leave, or because it is under a mental or magical compulsion, etc.

61-65

Infamy (reputation). The dragon seeks to be well known as a threat, but unlike the knight-killer it approaches the project in an
intelligent and possibly even devious manner.

66-70

Intense Greed. This dragon is even greedier than most, being easily bribed and unable to resist theft.

71-75

Kill Knights (reputation). The dragon seeks to be well known as a threat. Note that for survival reasons, this is already a fairly
dim bulb of a dragon, since the famous ones don’t live long. Being relatively stupid, this dragon is focused upon killing powerful
humans, and it defines “powerful” basically as those who wear heavy armor. This is the best explanation I can invent for the classic

Land-Destroyer. At whatever speed possible, the dragon seeks to turn the area around its lair into a wasteland. It spends time
fouling water, destroying trees and crops, and killing wildlife.

81-85

Political Power. The dragon seeks to have human slaves and influence over civilized areas, rather than eating (too many) humans
or destroying crops. This dragon might even protect its serfs in time of danger.

86-90

Secrets and Wisdom. The dragon knows a great deal of useful information; maps of a dungeon area, legends about magic items,
and other such useful tidbits can be gained from talking to this dragon rather than killing it. Of course, conversation might not be
possible unless the dragon is suitably terrified.

91-95

Vendetta. Some event in the dragon’s past has caused it to swear vengeance against a group, race, or religion. This could be
virtually anything ranging from a wide category like “magic-users,” to a single individual, to a specific village, to members of a
particular order of knights.

96-00

Wounded or Crippled. The dragon might be blind or missing a limb from a past accident or battle. If the dragon didn’t win that
combat, it is likely consumed with a desire for vengeance.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Elementals
Elementals are creatures associated with a fundamental “element” of
nature. These elements, as theorized by European alchemists, were fire,
water, earth, and air. The first explicit use of the elemental creature
concept is in Michael Moorcock’s Elric stories, in which Elric summons
the lord of the Earth elementals and the lord of the Water elementals.
The idea that elemental creatures are hierarchical comes from these
stories, and fantasy gaming further developed the idea of elemental
social strata by drafting djinn and efreet into the role of nobles. Not
only are genies closely associated with fire and air, but Arabian
folklore also ascribed to them the same kind of bargaining and binding
that characterized Moorcock’s elementals in the Elric stories. These
tables reflect the concept that there is an entire sub-world of creatures
associated with each element of nature, living in some “other” place but
capable of being summoned into normal reality – or perhaps sneaking
in from time to time. The creatures of these sub-worlds (presumably
treated as a separate plane of existence) are organized into social strata,
and can be bound to service in various ways.

Table 2-19: Elemental Plane of Origin
Inventing an elemental creature can go along one of two creative
avenues: either it’s a new and innovative use of one of the four basic
elements (fire, water, earth, and air), or it’s based on an unusual
element. The primary elements are the first four entries, so if you want
a “traditional” elemental you can roll a d4 and move forward. Note also
that if you want to generate something truly unusual, roll twice and
consider that your element might be from the intersection of the two
indicated elements.

Table 2-20: Method of Binding the Elemental Creature
One of the key features of elementals of all kinds, from genies to summoned elementals, is that they can be bound to the service of powerful
masters. In many cases, particularly in the case of the more intelligent elementals such as genies, there is a specific means by which the elemental
can be controlled (and serious risks if you get it wrong).

Although it’s really more of an adventure-generating idea than a monster-creating idea, you can get some good ideas about elementals by
thinking about what conditions are like in the elemental region whence the creature comes. This doesn’t mean the conditions of the entire elemental

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Fey Creatures
The concept of a fey creature is a gamer-created mishmash of virtually all folkloric creatures that don’t eat humans, aren’t of godlike power,
aren’t significantly larger than humans, are corporeal, and are basically of a human body type. The gamer model of fey creatures relies most heavily
on the sidhe (Ireland) and the wee folk (Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Bretagne) mixed in with corporeal nature-spirits from numerous other cultures
(the nymphs and dryads of Ancient Greek mythology being a prime example). These tables essentially retro-engineer the artificial category of
“Fey” by returning to the folkloric sources of the creatures commonly labeled as being in the category, drawing out resemblances and common
features. That being said, there is a general set of folkloric characteristics attributed to the traditional creatures of the “fey” category:
1 — They are associated with nature and the wilderness, and often tied to a specific place in the wilderness such as a tree or river;
2 — They are difficult to find when sought – often because they inhabit a sort of magically hidden “otherworld,” can vanish away if not
physically held, or can become invisible;
3 — Most are extremely cunning, but vulnerable to trickery due to their extreme pride or greed (generally for food or gold);
4 — They show virtually no compassion for human beings, with the exception of Victorian England’s tiny fairies with their butterfly wings and
flower-dwellings;
5 — They are corporeal;
6 — They are frequently (but not always) associated with magical items;
7 — They are frequently associated with transformations of themselves or those who anger them;
8 — They are, almost universally, absolutely forced to honor bargains to which they have agreed, even if the bargain was made under duress.
A major exception to the general rule: talking animals seem to have been adopted into this category, but these are generally helpful to humans
in most folklore, rather than compassionless. Helpful talking animals appear frequently in the troubadour tales of the proto-renaissance of the
Twelfth Century and in the Germanic folklore recorded by the Brothers Grimm. A second exception: the Irish sidhe (pronounced “shee”) and some
Arthurian fey-types are associated with unnatural passage of time in their realms and with taking slaves or captives. This isn’t a universal constant
among folkloric creatures, but it is a common theme nonetheless.
Final note about the tables: since the concept of fey is a bastardized catch-all type of category, the monster-designer should feel free to break as
many of these general rules as may be necessary to create a good monster.

It is a constantly recurring theme in folklore that the wee folk and

right bargain is struck or the right commands invoked. In this way, the
fey folk are much like genies and elementals (and the following table is
accordingly similar to Table 2-20).

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES
Table 2-28: Summoning Fey Creatures
Many fey creatures are subject to being summoned or called from their homes to assist the summoner. In general, some kind of bargain needs to
be struck, but the bargain could potentially already exist, or have been negotiated ahead of time. Since lots of these methods involve some kind of
speech, the required speech might include the offered terms of the bargain, which might influence the success of the summoning/calling.
Die Roll

Method of Summoning

01-10

Ancient Promise. Recital of an ancient promise of assistance is another way to summon a fey creature, but these are generally
difficult to discover, and the fey creature is likely to do whatever it can (later on) to make sure the recital isn’t passed on or used a
second time.

11-20

Body Part. If the summoner has a lock of the fey creature’s hair (or some other body part), a particular spoken charm or magic
word could be sufficient to call the creature

21-30

Creature’s Name. Knowing the creature’s name might be enough to summon it, particularly if there is a little rhyme, magic word,
dance, or pattern of steps to go along with speaking the name. (For some reason, movement of feet seems to be much more
associated with the fey than movement of arms or hands).

31-40

Creature’s Possession. Some fey creatures are linked to a particular possession (pipes, hat, etc) and can be called in virtually any
way if the summoner has possession of this item.

41-50

Insults and Place. Near the creature’s home, or in some other specified place like a circle of toadstools, a series of biting insults
might call the creature forth … but not necessarily in a good mood.

51-60

Musical Tune. Certain tunes, if played absolutely perfectly and without error, might summon the fey creature. In order to keep this
method from being used over and over again, it might be a tune that backfires dangerously if not played correctly.

61-70

Pattern. Creating the right pattern of crystals, sparkly stones, sticks of wood, branches of fir, etc) might summon forth this sort of
fey creature.

71-80

Place and Activity. The right combination of a place (ring of mushrooms, stone circle, near the creature’s home, etc) and an
activity (lighting a fire with pine cones, dancing, singing, cooking bacon, etc) might be an irresistible temptation for this sort of fey
creature’s greed or curiosity.

81-90

Place, Time, and Speech. It might be possible to summon the fey creature when there is a particular combination of the time
(autumn, midsummer, midnight, lunar phase, etc), the right words, and the right place (often a crossroads or a forest glade).

91-00

Smells. Cooking a certain combination of (strange) ingredients might summon the fey creature just from a smell the creature finds
irresistible.

72

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Giants
There are Norse giants, Celtic giants, Japanese giants (if that’s how you class the Oni), Ancient Greek giants, etcetera and etcetera. What’s
useful to the adventure-creator is that these giants are not at all the same in terms of what they look like, how they behave, and what their powers
are – with one exception being that they are almost universally pretty stupid. Ancient Greek giants (as opposed to the semi-divine titans) were
almost always deformed in some way; hundred-handed giants and the one-eyed Cyclops are examples. Norse giants are powerful enough to stand
toe-to-toe with the gods themselves, and are members of distinct races (fire and frost). Arthurian/Provencal giants do not seem to be members of
a race at all, but they all have brothers (usually in groups of three). The Japanese Oni have taken on a giant or ogre-like standard appearance, but
they are also highly associated with the spirit world and older folklore doesn’t always portray the Oni in this way (people can be possessed by oni,
for example). Celtic giants tend to be more intelligent than the giants of other cultures, even tricky in some cases.
It is an unfortunate result of the early adventure modules Steading of the Hill Giant Chief, Glacial Rift of the Frost Giant Jarl, and Hall of the
Fire Giant Chief that giants are often portrayed in role-playing games as tribal creatures. This isn’t the case in folklore, where giants tend to be
quite solitary and have unique powers. There is a lot of room in creative adventure design to take the folkloric model of the solitary giant with
unique powers and/or possessions and use it to craft an excellent adventure. Avoid, though, the fairy-tale sequence of the giant and his brothers;
it’s too repetitious – I’ve tried it.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Humanoids
This section isn’t just about goblinoids, it’s about any race of bipedal creatures without powerful magical abilities except in unusual members
of the species. For instance, since the “Fey” category tends to exclude monsters that have non-mammalian characteristics, monsters that are not
particularly hard to find, and monsters that eat humans, creatures with these attributes might fall into the category of “humanoids.”
Humanoid races are characterized by their physical structure, interactions with other races, animal alliances, social organization, and any unusual
or characteristic cultural behaviors. Put a bookmark at Table 2-2 while using these tables, because they refer back to it several times.
Make sure you roll independently for each column on the table.

Roll again on Table 2-2, using this second roll to determine a bunch of weird
modifications to the basic biped you created from the first roll. For example, your
bipedal fish-man now gets some attributes of a badger. Go for it.

Relation to Other Humanoid Races, including humans (d100)

Alliance with related beast-type*

Manipulators, diplomats, and infiltrators (this might be, but isn’t
necessarily, a mastermind race)

21-30

Minor special attack (all creatures in race)*** See Tables
2-78 and 2-79 for ideas.

Willing mercenaries, serving other races and possibly with some
degree of assimilation into the different cultures of their employers

31-40

Unusual ability (all creatures in race)****

Would-be conquerors, tyrants, or overlords; generally at war with
anyone or everyone

41-50

Unusual leader-types

Minion race that tends to serve more powerful overlords

51-60

Contains spell-casters that are not necessarily unusual
leader-types (but could be, if you want to play around with
Table 2-37)

Raiders (also possibly slavers)

61-70

Unusual Reproductive Cycle (See Morphological Changes
and Phases Table 2-84)

Mastermind race (see Tables 2-38 and 2-39 below)*****

71-80

Minor Special Defense (all creatures in the race). See Table
2-82 for ideas.

Slavers (not necessarily raiders – slaves might also be from another
humanoid race or monster type rather than humans)

81-90

Contains a sub-race which is larger than the norm, and is
either more or less intelligent than the normal members of the
species. The sub-race might be sterile, or might be capable of
interbreeding with the normal members of the species.

Most relations are trade-oriented, but the race may have strange
approaches to trade (violence, rituals, or honor might factor in, for
example). Trading with the creatures might be a dangerous venture.

91-00

Unusual leader-type or Unusual Ability in all members of
the race**** (50% chance each)

Generally assist other races and act in coordination with them, provided
that the other race is working toward goals that agree with those of the
race (or of the leader-types). This would be a race that works from longrange plans, possibly (but definitely not necessarily) a mastermind race.

*Alliance with related beast-type. Examples might include a race of crab-men that command or live with giant crabs, a race of wolf-like creatures that live with wolves, etc. In general,
the animal alliance will be with the same creature whose attributes are shared with the humanoid race.
**Interesting Weapon. The race manufactures and/or uses some weapon that other races can’t use well. A race of four-armed warriors might use a very heavy flail using all four hands,
as a very simple example. The key here, though, is that the weapon should have some effect that makes tactical combat interesting. The weapon might have a chance to disarm, poison,
cause disease, immobilize, hamper, or weaken opponents, or might just deal greater-than-normal damage in the hands of one of the members of the humanoid species.
*** Minor special attacks will also, generally, be related to the underlying animal type that has been mixed with human attributes to create the humanoid race. Crab-men might have
pincers, for example, or the ability to drag opponents under the water.
**** Unusual Abilities will be related to the underlying animal type. Crab-men would be able to breathe under water.
***** Even though Mastermind Race is listed as a relationship to other races, that doesn’t necessarily give the broadest picture – rolling a second time on Column 2 might get you an
interesting picture of how a mastermind race functions.

31-40

Intrinsic magical ability (see Table
2-25 for Transformations)

Is less like the underlying animals
and more like a human than the
lesser members of the race.

41-50

Has aspects of a fey creature
(Table 2-22 or 2-24)

Increased ability to move, using
strong legs/wings, or magical
movement such as teleportation,
dimensional travel, etc.

51-60

Has aspects of a giant (Tables 2-29
to 2-31)

Has a different reproductive
strategy from other members of
the race, which influences the
activities of the groups they lead

61-70

Has stronger armor or thicker hide
than normal. If the underlying
animal has armor and the lesser
members of the race don’t have it,
then give the leader-type the armor
of the underlying creature.

Is subject to a Time Cycle (Table
1-29) which influences the
activities of the groups they lead

71-80

Can cause a relatively powerful
effect on lesser members of the
race, such as increased ferocity or
bravery when close to a leadertype.

Requires a special food, drink,
or drug in order to maintain the
physical or mental characteristics
of a leader type. This may be a
substance produced by normal
members of the species (especially
in the case of insectile humanoids)

81-90

Can ride an extremely powerful
type of mount, dangerous to nonShape-changing, either generalized leader riders, or larger and more
intelligent than a type of mount
or as a form of lycanthropy
used by normal members of the
race.

91-00

Has a Special Defense (See Table
2-82 for ideas).

Smaller and more graceful than
normal members of the species

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES
Table 2-38: Thematic Ideas for Mastermind Humanoid Races
If the entire race is considerably more intelligent than humankind, the concept probably requires more detail. A race of masterminds will travel
in smaller groups instead of tribes, individuals may have minions from another race, and the race may make a recurring appearance in more than
one adventure. The table below offers various thematic groupings of ideas that can work together for the “signature” element of a mastermind
humanoid race. The items in each theme are sometimes contradictory, and the themes are vague and open-ended. They are intended to spark
thought processes, not to provide a closed and complete list.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES
Table 2-39: Racial History of Mastermind Races
In the case of mastermind races, adding some sort of background in addition to the themes of Table 2-38 may help to define how the members
of the race think. Use the table below to generate a sequential history of the race. There is a 50% chance that the race became masterminds during
the first stage, and (if they didn’t) a 50% chance in the second stage and a 100% chance in the third stage. Once this thought-exercise is finished,
and has given you ideas about the mastermind race, feel free to discard the details of the history – a racial history isn’t needed at all to have a good
monster race.

First Stage of Development

Second Stage of Development

01-10

Unevolved form was enslaved and
“improved” by a more powerful race

Became twisted by a catastrophe that
affected most members of the race

Generally get along with humankind,
except when humankind pisses them off

11-20

Evolved in another dimension

Some sort of interaction with a god or
other major power changed the race (or
split the race into two groups)

Consider humans to be nothing more than
slaves or even food

Evolved on a distant moon or planet

Needed to escape into another dimension,
world, or environment (e.g., chased
into and adapted to a subterranean
environment)

Became fragmented into small groups and
individuals due to the risk of disease

31-40

Created or bred by a deity, demigod, or
other major power.

Became powerful and ruled a large area,
but were then decimated by war, disease,
or rebelling slaves

Became fragmented into small groups and
individuals because ego and pride make
it impossible for them to work together.
They hate other members of their own
race.

41-50

Evolved underground

Enslaved by a more powerful race, which
bred them or magically changed them

Seek revenge or have a particular racial
hatred (not necessarily against humanity –
it might even be a monster type)

51-60

Evolved aboveground

Encountered lost knowledge, which
changed them and made them more
powerful and intelligent

Require a particular kind of food,
probably either a rare plant or humans
Became expert breeders of a monster
type (or new hybrid) that accompanies
most members of the race. If the
physical characteristics of the race were
determined using Table 2-2, the animal
is probably the underlying animal
used to generate the race’s physical
characteristics.
Reproductive competition separates
the males or females from each other.
The separated gender is polygamous
(or polyandrous), and the other gender
is probably smaller, weaker, and/or less
intelligent.

21-30

Final Stage of Development

61-70

Evolved in water

Arrived at present location (world, moon,
subterranean realms, etc) via a migration
to avoid a natural or magical catastrophe
in their original location

71-80

Created or bred by a more powerful race
(now extinct) to fulfill a specific function
in the society of that race – food, slaves,
accountants, spell-casters, etc.

Developed a caste structure with different
abilities for the different castes (this can
include entering into corporeal bodies of
different types)

81-90

Began as a race of incorporeal spiritbeings, gaining bodies as a result of the
events in the second stage (next column)

Entire race is now subject to a Time
Cycle (Table 1-29), although not all
Rebellion within the society caused a split members of the race are necessarily
within the race (a multiple caste structure, subject to the same influences at the same
times – they may be out of synch with
division into powerful leaders and lesser
each other. This would be due to events in
followers, or two hostile sub-races)
columns 1 or 2, but it has become more or
less pronounced than earlier.

91-00

Evolved as flying creatures, but unless
you want them to retain flight, they lose
their flying capabilities during the Second
Stage (next column)

Extinction of a more powerful race
allowed this race to grab power and
magic, which led to higher intelligence

80

Each member of the race accumulates
knowledge or unusual items that make
each individual member of the species
relatively unique in its capabilities.

Mist Creatures
Mist creatures are normally unintelligent, acting on instinct. They can normally be damaged in only a few ways, and often function in the nature
of a localized hazard. The table below offers two other suggestions: mist-monsters created by a machine, and mist-monsters created by another
monster-type. In addition to being a naturally-occurring phenomenon, they might also be created by divine (or demonic) vengeance, by the prayers
or invocations of a large number of people, by a dimensional rift, or by magical accidents.

Oozes (including slimes, molds, jellies, puddings, and other such icky things) are a staple of fantasy gaming. In some cases, oozes have been

Planar Creatures
Planar creatures are monsters having their origin or home in another dimension, reality, or plane of existence. There are five basic divisions of
planar creatures (angels aren’t really covered, since we’re focusing on monsters to fight during the course of an adventure).

Dark Angel (Planar Creature Type)
Dark angels are the tempters and plotters of demonic and fiendish realms. They have a basically human appearance, but with one or more
demonic hints. If the Dark Angel is engaged in infiltrating human society or tempting people into evil deeds, it will likely do its best to conceal or
downplay the demonic hint.

Demonic Creatures (Planar Creature Type)
Demonic creatures are not in the business of tempting or persuading anyone; they are destructive and feral, although they might be extremely
intelligent in their tactics and methods (they might, for example, assemble an army of minions). These sorts of demons can be more easily
controlled when they are summoned to a chaotic or evil caster’s service, but if the caster loses control the results will usually be violent and messy.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES

Summoned Creatures (Planar Creature Type)
Summoned creatures are those that aren’t demonic in nature, but come from some other dimension, alternate reality, other reality, or from a
non-demonic plane of existence. They don’t ordinarily cross over into the material plane, and are usually called forth for some specific purpose.
From my experiences with using the following tables, it works best to get an idea about what it’s summoned to do (Table 2-50) before generating
information about the creature’s body type– this helps to adjust the monster’s physical appearance when you roll on Table 2-51.

Table 2-50: Normal Purpose of Summoned Monster

Table 2-51: Physical Form of Summoned Creature

Note: This table is used to suggest physical appearance and powers
– a particular summoner in a particular adventure might be using the
creature for a completely different reason than the normal one.

Note: This table makes frequent references to Table 2-2, a list of
animals and their attributes. Sometimes it’s easier to just come up with
animal types on the fly while using this table, but if you want to get
completely random results, I would bookmark Table 2-2 before starting
to roll the dice.

Sample Generation of a
Summoned Creature
As one example of how to use these tables, let’s generate a
summoned creature.
First, we roll a result of 41 on Table 2-50, and discover that the
normal reason for summoning our creature is to use it as a food
harvester. Next, we roll a result of 78 on Table 2-51, learning
that the creature has the head of a beast, a human body, and a
tail. We roll a 60 on Table 2-2, which suggests that our creature
has the head of an octopus. One immediate idea coming from
these random results is that the creature is used to harvest food
underwater, since it has the head of an octopus.
We roll on Table 2-52 to see what it’s made of, and (rolling a
98 on the first column of that table) we discover that our creature
is made of green-flecked stone. And finally, rolling a 29 on
Table 2-53, we find that if the summons is done incorrectly, the
summoned creature will be weaker than normal, or deformed.
From somewhere, probably because the thing sounds so much
like Cthulhu, I decide that it is normally summoned by tribesmen
(and that’s either to catch some sort of big fish, or dive for pearls).
It sounds silly to have a stone statue swimming underwater, so
browsing through the tables I decide that it’s a fungus, instead of
being made of stone.
So now we have a creature that rises from a growth of fungus when
summoned, shaping the fungi into a massive man-shaped thing with
the head of an octopus, which harvests pearls at the dead of night in
deep waters. If the summons is not made correctly, the shape rising
from the fungi will be misshapen, and weaker than normal … or
perhaps diseased. H.P. Lovecraft would adore it.

Travelers (Planar Creature Type)
Travelers are trans-planar creatures that move across planes of existence on their own accord (as opposed to summoned creatures). Perhaps
the most important feature of these monsters, from the standpoint of designing an adventure, is why they do so. What is their motivation for
shifting from plane to plane, or from alternate world to alternate world? Obviously, most of these creatures are intelligent, often far above the
human norm. Predatory travelers should generally be treated as Horrors or Demonic Creatures (see above) rather than generated under the
tables below, which are designed to generate creatures with more complex motivations than mere feeding.

Visitations are (usually) non-intelligent manifestations of energy, overlapping with elementals and undead but best treated, for purposes of creating monsters, as a separate category. They are presumed to be acting on instinct, or might have no intelligence whatsoever, being a manifestation or echo of something happening in another plane rather than creatures in their own right. An intelligent visitation would be possible, but
unusual. Something that created a sapient echo in the material plane would be a very significant extra-planar event indeed.

Plant Creatures
Good plant monsters are really hard to design. They’ve not only got to be pretty creative, but you’ve also got to work within several constraints: firstly, most of them don’t move, so they don’t offer much of a tactical challenge, and secondly, there just aren’t many real-world predatory plants to work from as a starting point.

Basic Form (d100)

Specific Type of Form (d100)

01-05 Bamboo

Limbs or body-part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile (rooted). The plant is purely a melee
fighter. (Roll on Table 2-74: Limb Attacks)

06-10 Broad leaves

Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special attack to augment
damage from the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for the limbs, and roll on Table
2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the augmenting attack.

11-15 Bush or shrub

Limbs or body part moves, but the rest of the plant is immobile. The plant uses a special “pulling” attack
to draw prey to the limbs: roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for the limbs, and roll on
Table 2-61 to get ideas for the nature of the special pulling attack.

16-20 Cone

Limbs or a body part of the plant move (roll on Table 2-74 for ideas), but the rest of the plant is immobile.
The plant not only uses a special “pulling” attack to draw prey towards it, but also has a special attack to
augment damage from the limbs. Roll on both columns of Table 2-61 to determine the nature of the pulling
and augmenting special attacks.

21-25 Coral-type growth

No part of the plant moves, but it delivers a poisonous or transformational substance into its near vicinity.
Delivery mechanisms include: spores, smells, spiked seed-pods on the ground, blown leaves, and gases.
The result of falling prey to these substances include turning into a similar plant, turning into a plant-creature controlled by the plant, turning into a seed-carrier for the plant, or just dying to create fertilizer. Keep
in mind that creatures killed for fertilizer might also be caused to rot faster than normal after dying.

26-30 Fern

No part of the plant moves, but it has mental powers. These probably include the telekinetic ability to damage opponents using nearby rocks or equipment, or even picking opponents up. Other possibilities include
mental powers that mimic enchantment-type magic – the plant can dominate someone’s mind to create an
ally (who will later be used to fetch fertilizing carcasses to the plant’s roots).

31-35 Grass-like stalks

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility types). It is purely a melee fighter, using its
movement ability solely to get into close enough range for hand-to-branch combat. Roll on the Limb Attacks Table (2-74) to get ideas for how it attacks.

36-40 Hanging moss

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility types). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has an augmenting attack from Table 2-61.

41-45 Ivy

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-59 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a pulling attack from Table 2-61.

46-50 Lump

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a pulling attack AND an augmenting attack, both from Table 2-61

51-55 Mold

The plant is entirely immobile, but it has a Physical Distance Attack (see Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent).

56-60 Mushroom

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Physical Distance Attack from Table 2-62. The Physical
Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent).

61-65 Sphere

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (see Table 2-74 Limb Attacks), it has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-61) AND an Augmenting
Attack (Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent).

66-70 Thorn-bush

The plant is entirely immobile, but it has a Physical Distance Attack (see Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack has a Special Effect (Table 2-62).

71-75 Tree, palm

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (see Limb Attacks Table), it has a Physical Distance Attack from Table 2-62. The Physical Distance
Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent).

76-80 Tree, pine

The plant is mobile (see Table 2-60 for ideas about mobility methods). In addition to fighting with mobile
limbs (see Limb Attacks Table), it has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-62) AND an Augmenting Attack (Table 2-62). The Physical Distance Attack causes general damage (hit points or equivalent).

81-85 Tree, short

The plant is rooted to the ground, but super-charged with weaponry. It has a melee attack (see Table 2-74
Limb Attacks), a pulling attack (Table 2-61), and a Distance Attack with a Special Effect.

86-90 Tree, tall

The plant moves (Table 2-60) and has a Physical Distance Attack (Table 2-62) with a special effect. However, it does not have a melee attack of any kind.

Augmenting Attacks

Special Pulling Attacks

01-10

The plant has the equivalent of a mouth, which could include
splitting a large part of itself open (like a Venus Flytrap) or even
splitting its whole body open. The mouth is the main source of
damage: it might crush its victims, or it might have the plant
equivalent of teeth, using internal thorns or spines. A mouth with a
sludgy interior might slop the victim with digestive juices. Unless
the plant is mobile and fast, it will need some sort of motile grabbing limb to get its victims into the mouth.

Hallucinogenic dust, spores, or smell causes victim to see
the plant as something attractive that he wants to touch. An
attractive member of the opposite sex or piles of treasure
are good examples, although the specific nature of your adventure might suggest other ideas. Roll on table 2-61 to get
ideas about how the plant delivers the substance.

11-20

The plant has motile vines or tendrils that inflict an unusual type
of additional damage, usually automatic and progressive if the
tendrils manage to grab and hold the victim. The following are
ideas for such damage: poison (instantly lethal, progressively
lethal, or progressively damaging), heat, cold, acid, electricity,
squeezing, and thorns.

The plant can animate other nearby plants (probably symbiotes) so that they entangle and pull prey toward it.

21-30

The plant enfolds its victims and begins to digest them using
acidic sap or other digestive substances.

The plant uses a rudimentary form of magic to enchant its
prey. The victim walks toward the plant, and takes no other
actions.

31-40

The plant enfolds its victims and begins to incorporate them
into its own body, changing them to plant matter or lacing them
through with tiny digestive tendrils that aren’t easily removed.

The plant uses a rudimentary form of magic to enchant its
prey. The victim will eventually be eaten, but first it will try
to pull nearby creatures (other characters) toward the plant.

41-50

The plant’s motile limbs can cause the victim to become paralyzed The plant issues a highly attractive narcotic smell, which
or otherwise helpless (go limp from pleasurable narcotic, be elec- causes victims to forget what they are doing and move
toward the plant.
trically stunned, turn rigid from a poisonous substance, etc).

51-60

Confusion. A substance on the plant’s motile limbs acts like a
drug, causing victims to move, or even attack, randomly.

The plant has an organ (possibly even a human-looking eye)
that functions as a gaze attack. The organ might always be
visible, or part of the plant might open up to reveal it during
combat. Those affected by the attack will move toward the
plant.

61-70

The plant has a substance (coated with sap or slime) or an injector
(thorns) on its body. Motile limbs grab victims and carry them
to the body so that these short-range weapons can be used. The
substance causes a transformation in the victim. He progressively
turns into a “plant zombie” with seeds attached to him, and starts
traveling around while shedding the seeds (this is how the plant
reproduces).

The plant has a rudimentary teleportation ability. For an
interesting twist, try having teleportation be the result of a
failed saving throw against a Physical Distance Attack on
Table 2-61. That’s pretty darn weird.

71-80

The plant’s motile limbs stun a victim for short periods of time
when they hit (a saving throw might or might not apply). If the
limbs cause clubbing-type damage, the stunning is simply caused
by the force of the blow. If the limbs cause cutting or piercing
type damage, then the stunning is caused by a weak poison in the
creature’s sap.

The plant zaps potential victims with a magical ray, hypnotizing or charming them. They proceed to walk zombie-like
into the plant’s clutches.

The plant is a dangerous one, with lethal poison on its limb attack.
The poison might not be instantly lethal, but it’s a possibility –
especially if the plant is rooted to the ground, since an escaping
poison victim won’t die near the roots. Slow poison; no fertilizer.

The plant can grow thin roots (about the width of twine)
that crawl out very quickly from the plant’s central body. If
one of these roots manages to catch up with prey, the central
plant pumps nutrients into it, letting it thicken to the width
of a rope that can haul the victim back by the ankles. This
sort of attack makes for a good tactical encounter, since the
rootlets can grow around corners and the party might have to
divide its efforts between attacking the plant’s central body
or hacking at little rootlets.

Physical Distance Attack

Special Effect of Distance Attack (If Applicable)

01-05

Bomb or grenade-type attack. The plant hurls big
seed-pods, spore-sacs, or gas-bulbs. They might
hit the target directly or not, but they also have a
burst radius.

Acid (damage for a series of rounds, and stronger acids might damage equipment)

06-10

Exhaled cloud (gas or mist)

Cold. Some sort of chemical reaction in the substance of the distance attack
makes it cause damaging cold. For the life of me, I can’t figure out how this
would fit into a plant’s life cycle, but it’s an interesting thought, isn’t it?

11-15

Exhaled cone (gas or mist)

Confusion. The substance is like a drug, causing victims to move, or even attack,
randomly.

16-20

Gas or mist (radial release in all directions)

Disease causing a transformation in the victim. He progressively turns into a
“plant zombie” with seeds attached to him, and starts traveling around while
shedding the seeds (this is how the plant reproduces).

21-25

Gas or mist: exhaled stream at single opponent

Disease causing a transformation in the victim: turns into one of these plant
creatures (in a matter of days).

26-30

Horrid, massive, vomit-eruption of liquid or goo
(short range, but hits anyone in the area)

Disease causing slow but progressive onset of paralysis (not lethal, but the effects might last for days).

31-35

Hurls, fires, or spits: needles, thorns or spikes

Disease causing victim to carry spores or seeds. In a matter of days, he turns
into a “bag” of spores or seeds, and explodes or otherwise dies. This is how the
plant spreads its seeds. There should be a physical sign of the condition so the
players know that they need to get the character cured before he dies.

36-40

Ray (uses eyelike organ, eyestalks, or other noneyelike organ)

Disease with slow onset of death (measured in several melee rounds, not days).

41-45

Smell (directed squirt at a single target)

Double-whammy. The victim gets an uncontrollable hunger to eat fruit from the
plant. Not only does this bring him close to the plant, where it can attack him, but
the fruit does something very unpleasant as well, if he manages to eat it.

46-50

Smell (in a directed cone)

Hallucinations. These could cause a multitude of effects: fear, confused and
unpredictable actions, attempts to damage oneself, etc.

51-55

Smell (radius)

Heat. Some sort of chemical reaction is intended to cook the plant’s food.
Powerful versions of this might cause metal armor to inflict damage for more
than one combat round.

56-60

Spit (glob or liquid, single target)

Lethal poison with rapid or immediate onset of death.

61-65

Spit (line of liquid, ooze, or sap)

Lethal poison with slow onset (but probably causing immediate and
progressive weakness).

66-70

Spores (cone)

Mental control by plant. The substance delivered by the physical distance attack allows the victim to perceive mind-waves emanating from the plant, and
he follows its commands. If he makes a saving throw, he might get the interesting result of hearing the commands but not feeling compelled to follow them.

71-75

Spores (launches a “bag” that explodes)

Non-lethal poison causing fear (flight or disorganized retreat).

76-80

Spores (line toward single opponent)

Non-lethal poison causing lethargy or slowness of action.

81-85

Spores (radial “burst”)

Non-lethal poison causes mental-type paralysis (renders victim utterly blissful,
causes victim not to care about movement, causes paralyzing fear, etc).

86-90

Spray (cone of liquid, ooze, or sap)

Non-lethal poison causing physical paralysis.

91-95

Spray (line of liquid, ooze, or sap aimed at single
opponent)

Non-lethal poison causing effective paralysis: e.g., nausea or seizures.

96-00

Squirt liquid (single target)

Uncontrolled emotion. The effect of the substance on humans is an uncontrolled
emotion such as berserker rage, incapacitating sorrow, fits of uncontrolled laughter,
or some similar effect.

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — MONSTER TYPES
Table 2-63: Sample Unusual Reproduction Methods for Plants
In many cases, a plant-monster’s attack method is involved with the plant’s reproductive cycle. In cases where it isn’t, and when you want to
add a bit of weirdness to the plant’s overall nature, this short table offers a couple of unusual modes of plant reproduction to spark your creativity. Note that the primary reproductive strategy for plants is a matter of making seeds travel as far as possible from the parent-plant.
Die Roll

Reproductive Cycle

01-20

The plant injects or drops seeds into the water. The seeds become tadpole-like creatures (animal or vegetable, it doesn’t matter). The
tadpoles swim to new locations using their whip-like tails. They die, and the internal seed-matter beings to grow as a new plant.

21-40

The plant doesn’t just produce seeds – it produces flying insects (whether these are true animals or plant-insects doesn’t matter).
The insects fly about for a while, die, fall to the ground, and germinate into new plants.

41-60

By whatever means the plant might also grab hold of adventurers, it grabs birds and small animals such as rabbits and chipmunks.
It injects these creatures with seed-larva. Then it releases the small creature, which carries along on its merry way until the larva
eat it from within and germinate in its dead carcass.

61-80

The plant drops a “phase one” seed into the ground. The phase one seed grows into a small, mobile plant that scurries away. The
mobile plant proceeds to scatter “phase two” seeds as it travels. The “phase two” seeds grow into the original plant form, which
then begins to produce more “phase one” seeds.

81-00

The plant produces a shiny, gem-like seed. These are picked up by birds, which carry them away to put into nests. When the seeds
sprout, they send out little vines that feed upon eggs.

Undead
In folklore, almost all undead creatures arise from some sort of break in the normal life cycle as that culture defines the life cycle (and that’s
not always the same in all cultures). Some ceremony wasn’t performed – often burial or last rites, or some action taken by the undead person
during his life represented a breach of the natural order of things. The tables below focus on this aspect of Undeath, although first there’s a
comprehensive list of undead “types” to help you focus on the explanation, which you might generate with the later tables. Obviously, if your
“explanation” of the undead creature generates a fantastic idea that doesn’t mesh with the type, stick with your imagination, not with the tables.

Verminous Creatures
Verminous creatures are often relatively small, and are usually the “trash-collectors” of a dungeon or other area. In some cases, you might want
to have larger verminous creatures (a mutant or something), and these tables will work fine for the larger specimens as well. However, oozes
also serve well for this type of monster, and so do the “macrobiotes.”

Vermin Movement-Systems
Vermin are generally a “filler” type of monster, and unusual vermin are usually inspired by the pre-existing nature of the adventure’s location.
However, if you’re taking the interesting approach of getting adventure inspiration from a type of vermin, here is one way to go about it. The
following table addresses some different ways in which vermin might move around through the adventure area. The table is probably more useful in the context of a specific adventure scenario than for the generation of a particular species of vermin, but since it pertains to a specific class
of monster it is included here.

Table 2-71: Vermin Movement-Systems
Die Roll

Mode of Movement

01-20

Delivery and Retrieval. Some mechanism or process in the adventure area delivers the vermin to a location and then retrieves them
(or lets them die). This is an analogy to the use of “scrubbing bubbles,” or nano-technology. It doesn’t need to be high-tech or even
well explained. Perhaps a chute simply delivers green slime or rats to a particular location, and then spouts corrosive gas into the
area when the vermin are assumed to have eaten whatever needs to be eaten. Or perhaps a big suction-hose gathers them up after a
period of time.

21-40

Dimensional movement or lairs. Whether or not the vermin have any dimensional powers that manifest in combat, they live and/or
move about through some other dimension (not another plane of existence – just another dimension). This might be a feature of the
vermin themselves, or it might be an odd feature of the adventure area.

41-60

Elemental association. The vermin move through an elemental plane of some kind. In this case, they are probably elemental creatures of some kind, or a hybrid of “pure” elemental matter and normal “mixed” material.

61-80

Through tunnels burrowed in the walls, ceiling, or floors. The standard, in other words.

81-00

Vermin infest moving monsters. Perhaps the vermin are parasites, or perhaps their larvae are dropped from the movement of some
other kind of monster (a golem?). This would keep the vermin population moving around.

Part Two:
General Monster Tables

Overall Combat Profile

This table generates an overall combat profile for a monster, regardless of type. The first column addresses the monster’s attack profile by
identifying the body parts used for physical attacks (each body type leading to a specific subtable), and the number of special attacks the monster
uses (generated on Special Attack subtables). The second column (which contains only a small number of actual entries) sets the number of special defenses the monster uses. In addition to special defenses, the second column sets the monster’s number of Distinctive Attributes. Distinctive Attributes can be skipped in favor of moving on to the specific monster types after generating a combat profile.

Example Results

Table 2-75: Body Attacks
Die Roll

Let’s say you want to create a monster using the method in Part
Two, which starts with Table 2-72.
The first step is to roll on Table 2-72. Let’s say that the results are
a 20 on column 1 (for the Physical and Special Attacks) and a 52 on
column 2 (for the Special Defenses). So, column 1 gives a head, tail,
and a special attack. The 52 rolled on column 2 says that the monster
has two Special Defenses and one Distinctive Attribute.
First we roll results for the head and the tail attacks. We roll a 76 on
Table 2-73 (for the head attack) and a 17 on Table 2-76 (for the tail
attack). These results indicate that we have a monster with a horned
head (one horn), and a tail that crushes and constricts. Furthermore,
the monster has a special attack. Rolling on Table 2-78 (we roll a 61),
we discover that the creature emits some sort of clicking noise, with
a special-attack type of effect. Rolling on Table 2-79 (let’s say we
roll a 23), we find that the creature causes cold damage by using this
clicking noise. Odd but very interesting. Finally, we roll two special
defenses on Table 2-82 and a Distinctive Attribute on Table 2-83.
Let’s say the results are a 45 and a 79 for the Special Defenses, and a
64 for the Distinctive Attribute. These results tell us that the monster
is immune to transmutation-type magic, can summon animal allies,
and that its death can curse or damage the killer.
Developing the idea: We’ve got a monster with one horn, a constricting tail, and a cold-based attack, which basically gave me two
initial ideas. The first image was a white, furry, tadpole-like thing,
which I dismissed as stupid, and the second idea was a white yetiape monster with a long whip-tail. Neither of these is exactly what
the table describes, since a tadpole-thing would technically be crushing with its body, not a tail, and the yeti-monster would probably be
getting some limb attacks that the table doesn’t call for. That’s not a
problem: go with the visualization, not the table.
Suddenly it occurred to me, though, that the tadpole idea actually
works pretty well if this is an aquatic monster. Take the head of a
swordfish, give it an eel-type body with a long tail, and you’ve got
a neat, nasty, subterranean fish. It doesn’t need to be arctic at all –
instead, it has a special attack that causes cold damage underwater.
The table suggests that this eyeless cave fish with its goring attack, tail attack, and cold-damage clicking attack can also summon
animal allies (more of its own kind, perhaps). I’ll go with that, but
I basically decide to discard the immunity to magic and the deathcurse. The death-curse simply doesn’t fit unless this is a really high
level, almost mythological creature, and the immunity to magic just
seems like too much.
Obviously this example is just one way of approaching Part Two,
but it should give you an idea of how the tables can be used to generate a monster.

Table 2-79: Special Attack Type
Die Roll

Special Attack

01

Acid Damage (affecting action). The attack causes acidic damage to the target, but there’s also a special effect involved – if the
victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc) he takes some action in response to or as a result of
the acid (usually either due to panic or pain). The most likely candidates for involuntary responses to acid are panic (running), losing actions (getting acid off your skin), dropping items, or something similar.

02

Acid Damage (causes condition). In addition to normal damage and collateral damage the attack causes to equipment, the acid
has a chance to put the victim into a particular combat condition – blindness being the most obvious, whether it’s permanent
or temporary. Other possibilities for such “special” acids might include: damaged sight resulting in combat penalties (but not
complete blindness), a loss of charisma points, permanent scarring, or some other chemical reaction (perhaps this sort of acid turns
re-grown skin blue, for example).

03

Acid Damage (hit or miss). The attack causes electrical damage, but a successful saving throw means that the target incurs
no damage. In other words, the saving throw functions as a to-hit roll and if it is successful the attack missed. Another way of
handling this is to require an attack roll for the attack itself (and then don’t allow a saving throw). If the attack hits, items and
equipment spattered with the acid are at great risk of damage (this is one of the signature features of acid as an attack form). Also,
acid attacks often cause damage for more than one round.

04

Acid Damage (progressive). The victim takes acid damage, but continues to take damage in later combat rounds (probably a
random number of rounds, but possibly a set number of rounds with declining damage each time – it’s up to you). The continuing
damage would almost certainly prevent spell casting, but might also create penalties on saving throws, attack rolls, and/or movement rate. Also, items spattered with the acid may be ruined. Progressive damage over several rounds (with attendant problems
caused by pain) and the high likelihood of damaged equipment are the hallmarks of fantasy acid.

05

Acid Damage (save for half damage). The target takes half damage if he makes a successful saving throw; items he carries are
also at risk of being destroyed by the acid. Generally, acid attacks are highly dangerous to items (even more so than fire attacks)
and the effect lingers for more than a single combat round.

06

Adhesiveness and Friction. The special attack makes things stick to other things, or makes them slippery. This could be a magical power, a mental power, or it might be that the monster spits glue or oil. The obvious use of this power is to stick people in
place, prevent them from moving, or make them drop (or unable to release) weapons. However, such an ability could also be used
to give the monster extra mobility (if it slides), to haul opponents around (if the glue is at the end of a rope or tentacle), to attach
dangerous things to other things, or as part of a characteristic trap the monster sets.

07

Affect Ground or Rock. This special attack can be used to open holes in the ground, collapse walls, cause the ground to grab
people, etc. In many cases, only one particular kind of effect will be possible; the monster might be able to open cracks in the
floor but not collapse walls, for example. Turning rock into mud (and back) is one interpretation of this sort of ability, and so is the
use of a terrible roar to collapse ceilings.

08

Affect Metal. The monster can control metal (probably one specific type). This can include causing the metal to animate, affecting it as a magnet, making it rust, heating it up, chilling it to deadly low temperatures, causing it to conduct electricity, shaping it at
will, making it brittle, changing its physical properties, causing it to constrict, or some combination thereof.

Table 2-79: Special Attack Type Continued
Die Roll

Special Attack

09

Affect Stone or Wood. This is likely a form of rapid corrosion, but it could also be the ability to cause tremors in the substance,
heat/cool it, warp it, shape it, or otherwise use it to damage people.

10

Affect Use of a Limb. This special attack can sever, destroy, or immobilize one of the victim’s limbs. If the special attack is
delivered by touch, this is probably a tentacle, whip, or other “grabbing” type of attack (attacks that sever limbs should be left to
the really dangerous and rare monsters). If the attack is delivered at a range (by a gaze attack, for example), this might represent
partial paralysis, a partial flesh-to-stone, or a chemical change that doesn’t affect the entire body.

11

Affect Wood. The monster can control living and/or dead wood, cause it to animate, affect it like a magnet, heat it up, chill it,
cause it to conduct electricity, cause it to act like a vampiric bloodsucker, shape it at will, or some combination thereof. In many
cases, the monster will have a single, specific thing it can do, although some more powerful monsters might have a generalized
ability to animate and control wood.

12

Animate Objects. The monster can animate nearby objects to serve as allies. Consider a few of the following ideas: perhaps the
monster makes a specific object and has these around for use – indeed, it may be that the creature can only animate a specific type
of pre-prepared object. Some monsters might also be restricted to animating objects made of a certain substance, made during a
certain time period, or made by a certain race.

13

Asphyxiation. This special attack removes or reduces the target’s ability to breathe. It could be by pulling the victim underwater,
by filling the victim’s lungs with fluid, by choking the victim’s neck, by suffocating the victim, by removing the victim’s memory
of how to breathe, by surrounding the victim with dust or smoke, or a variety of other methods. Death is not immediate, and the
period of time required for the victim to die can be measured out in several ways: a set number of combat rounds, a random number of combat rounds, a number of combat rounds related to the victim’s constitution score, a number of rounds related to the victim’s level, or a series of saving throws until the victim finally succumbs. Don’t worry if the character seems to be able to hold his
breath for an incredibly long time – just assume that he manages to catch a gasp of air somehow during the process – the important
thing is to make the attack work well as part of the game, not to simulate exactly how long a person can hold his breath.

14

Aversion. The special attack creates an aversion to something, often an aversion to animals related to the monster, or to situations
involving the monster’s normal surroundings. For example, a giant, intelligent beetle’s special attack might cause an aversion to
beetles or bugs. Or, if the beetle is a subterranean creature, the special attack might cause an aversion to darkness. A table of Aversions is also contained in a later book.

15

Bleeding and Healing. This sort of special attack either causes ongoing damage (probably from bleeding or bloodsucking, but
possibly for other reasons such as caustic materials) or causes damage that doesn’t heal in the normal fashion. Ongoing damage
is probably for a random number of rounds, rolling damage again each round. A list of possibilities: bleeding caused by jagged
wound, bleeding caused by blood-thinning chemical, magical nature of bite/claw, cursed nature of bite/claw, mild poison in bite/
claw/stinger, chemical reaction continues until the catalyst is used up (like acid), or a substance continues burning or producing energy until it is used up. (Yes, I know the last two are technically the same thing). If the special attack causes damage that doesn’t
heal normally, there are a few possibilities: (1) the damage cannot be cured by magical healing and must be regained by normal
rest, (2) the damage can only be cured by magical healing, (3) the damage cannot be cured without a specific spell to neutralize
poison, remove curse, or dispel magic, whichever seems appropriate to the monster’s nature.

16

Body Infestation. This special attack infests the victim’s body with a plant or animal growth. The result might be extremely
minor: “you have fleas,” problematic, “flea bites are distracting you and causing you to attack at –1,” or quite deadly, “an enormous flea is growing inside you: each round you attack at a cumulative –1 to hit, and on round 10 you die unless cured.” Vermin
and fungi are the obvious candidates for this sort of attack, but this sort of attack would also include undead worms, growths that
are contagious if the character gets too close to the other characters, and a variety of other possibilities. Conditions that worsen as
time goes on work well with this sort of attack.

17

Bury. The attack buries the victim in some sort of substance, digs him down into the ground, or hauls up dirt and stone to cover
him. Possible substances for a burial-type attack might include slime, ashes, gravel, plaster, hardening resin, rock, sand, and even
water.

18

Charisma Loss. The attack drains one or more points of charisma from the victim. The attacker may or may not gain a benefit
from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems to fit well with the concept. If the
victim reaches a charisma score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one of several things might happen: the victim might die and
become a creature similar to the attacker, or might remain alive as the attacker’s mental slave. Another possibility is that the victim just dies, and a third possibility is that restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned naturally is now a
permanent condition requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might be temporary or permanent – this
is up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

19

Cloud Vortex. Similar to the “Elemental” and “Energy” Vortex attacks, this is an attack in which the monster calls forth mist,
smoke, steam, vapor, fog, or some other kind of gas in a whirlwind of power. The victim takes some damage from being hurled
around, but the distinguishing feature is the effect of the substance being used for the vortex. It might be poisonous, might be
choking, might be hot, might be cold, might conduct electricity, might dispel magic, or could have any number of other properties.
The cloud probably lingers more than one combat round, possibly trapping its victims within, possibly moving from one victim to
another, or possibly just remaining in one place as a potential obstacle during the rest of the combat.

Special Attack

20

Clumsiness. Victim suffers one or more of the following: a penalty to hit, a penalty to armor class, inability or reduction in spell
casting, and/or the chance to drop any items he is holding. Actual dexterity score is not necessarily affected. The way in which
the attack causes clumsiness could include overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical
reaction (mysterious chemicals in the creature’s spittle); the aftereffects of an electrical shock; or a very weak poison, curse, or
disease. The duration could range from only a couple of combat rounds to days in length.

21

Cold Damage (all or none). A blast of cold either hits or misses the target – this can be governed by an all-or-nothing saving
throw, or it might be an attack for which the attacker needs to make a to-hit roll. Cold temperature normally wouldn’t cause much
collateral damage to items or equipment unless it is an unusually magical type of cold (perhaps affecting metal more than other
substances, for example).

22

Cold Damage (manifestation). The special attack brings into being an abstract shape of pure coldness (serpentine, mist, etc).
The manifestation causes cold damage (or makes a separate attack) each round for a set duration.

23

Cold Damage (save for half damage). A blast of cold inflicts hit-point damage, half if the target makes a saving throw or similar
avoidance check. Unlike fire, cold damage doesn’t usually risk much collateral damage to items and equipment. Cold damage can
include such things as blasting particles of ice, or visibility-obscuring snow.

24

Cold Damage (unusual collateral damage). Cold temperature normally doesn’t affect items or substances – at least, not in the
traditional “save for half damage” type of attack. Cold attacks causing an unusual type of collateral damage are thus quite memorable, because they’re a bit unexpected. A few possibilities include: metal is chilled and causes damage for more than one round;
potions or other liquids freeze with some sort of random or unexpected effect; torch fire freezes; leather has a risk of turning brittle
and breaking, etc.

25

Command Plants or Animals. The monster can command nearby plants or animals to serve as his allies. If the monster is a
plant-monster, it may have a specific type of slave-plant (possibly a weaker monster-type with different abilities) that it can command or animate. A more powerful monster might be a general plant-lord type, or perhaps it can command any sort of fungus but
not other types of plants. Animal-controlling monsters, as with plant-controllers, might be limited to specific types of animals
(mammals, reptiles, etc) or might have a particular type of animal they breed, control, or live in symbiosis with. In some cases,
animal or plant controllers (especially the ones with a specific type of ally) can turn their victims into that kind of plant or animal.

26

Constitution Loss. The attack drains one or more points of constitution from the victim. The attacker may or may not gain a
benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems to fit well with the concept. If
the victim reaches a constitution score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one of several things might happen: the victim might
die and become a creature similar to the attacker, or might remain alive as the attacker’s mental slave. Another possibility is that
the victim just dies, and a third possibility is that restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned naturally is
now a permanent condition requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might be temporary or permanent
– this is up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

27

Curse (strategic). A “curse” can be almost anything, but what distinguishes it is that it responds to particular spells that remove
… curses. If the party happens to have a “remove curse” spell handy, the special attack’s power can easily be negated, unless this
is a super-powered curse of some kind. Strategic curses are long-term curses that don’t necessarily have much immediate effect
in a combat, but have repercussions in the game outside the realm of combat. Some of these are purely cosmetic, and would be
reflected only in the role-playing environment: a change in skin color, a long nose (perhaps it grows when you tell a lie!), a change
in gender – all of these are excellent curses even though they don’t affect the game itself. Other strategic curses are those which
restrict decision-making in between combats if they aren’t dealt with. Examples of this type of curse include a “quest to obtain the
grail,” or “give half your treasure to the evil cult.”

28

Curse (tactical). A “curse” can be almost anything, but what distinguishes it is that it responds to particular spells that remove
… curses. If the party happens to have a “remove curse” spell handy, the special attack’s power can easily be negated, unless this
is a super-powered curse of some kind. A “tactical” curse is one that focuses on the basic die rolls and mechanisms of the game
– “strategic” curses focus more on flavor or other aspects of the game outside the combat rules. Tactical curses will generally
accomplish one or more of the following: (1) lower an ability score, (2) cause random actions (running, singing, etc), possibly
triggered by a low attack roll or with a risk of onset when the character attempts a particular action, (3) cause a specific sort of action, such as attacking allies or sleeping, when the curse is triggered by a bad die roll or other triggering event, (4) cause a penalty
to attack rolls, damage rolls, and/or saving throws, (5) give the character a small chance of sudden death when attempting certain
actions like running, attacking, casting a spell, walking into the light, etc, (6) cause a small amount of hit point damage whenever
the character undertakes a particular action such as running, etc (see the preceding list), (7) change the character’s location when
certain events take place, either by teleportation or by uncontrollable or random movement, (8) cause a chance of paralysis or sleep
when the character undertakes a particular action (see the preceding list), cause the character to lose a level or a particular number
of experience points (9) remove or restrict spell casting ability, (10) reduce the character’s movement. Other tactical curses can
include transformations such as polymorph or other spell-like effects such as a charm.

29

Dangerous Barriers. The monster can create barriers such as walls of thorns, walls of fire, bubbles of temporary levitation, banks
of whirling blades, or whatever. Here are lists of possible types of barriers and possible types of composition. Types: wall, circle,
spiral, shrinking circle, cube, moving wall, short fence, cloud, thread, rope. Composition: fire, cold, ice, frost, earth, water, gas,
blades, swords, daggers, spears, thorns, magical force, mental force, mental domination, aversion, disease, poison, insanity, sound,
song, screams, nausea, fear, pincers, stingers, claws, confusion.

30

Death (magic or poison). The special attack uses death magic or poison to cause instant death if the target fails a saving throw.
Alternatively, targets with a minimum number of levels or hit dice might be immune to the attack.

111

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — GENERAL MONSTER TABLES
Table 2-79: Special Attack Type Continued
Die Roll

Special Attack

31

Death (progressive attribute score loss). If the target fails a saving throw, the result is likely to be death. The victim loses a
point of some particular attribute score (strength, dexterity, constitution, intelligence, wisdom, or charisma) periodically until the
score reaches zero and death results. The process can be stopped in different ways depending on the nature of the attack. If it is a
curse, it can be removed, if it is a form of poison it can be neutralized, if it is a form of disease it can be cured. If it is none of the
above, then there might still be a “folkloric” antidote – an action that negates the attack for no scientific reason. The most obvious
example of a folkloric antidote is to kill the attacker before the draining process is complete. Less obvious examples might include
stopping to drink lots of water, divesting oneself of all metal objects, etc. Folkloric antidotes might completely stop the draining
process or they might just hold it in abeyance.

32

Death (progressive dexterity loss). If the target fails a saving throw, the result is likely to be death. The victim loses a point of
dexterity periodically until dexterity reaches zero and death results. The process can be stopped in different ways depending on
the nature of the attack. If it is a curse, it can be removed, if it is a form of poison it can be neutralized, if it is a form of disease
it can be cured. If it is none of the above, then there might still be a “folkloric” antidote – an action that negates the attack for no
scientific reason. The most obvious example of a folkloric antidote is to kill the attacker before the draining process is complete.
Less obvious examples might include stopping to drink lots of water, divesting oneself of all metal objects, etc. Folkloric antidotes
might completely stop the draining process or they might just hold it in abeyance.

33

Dehydrate, Desiccate, Suck Fluids. This special attack sucks blood or dehydrates the victim (possibly all the way into powder).
For “standard” bloodsucking, the process starts only with a successful to hit roll and then the attacker causes automatic damage
thereafter without rolling to hit. Consider, though, the following ideas: (1) a “ranged” attack of this nature might be pulling bodily
fluids out into a mist for the monster to collect later, (2) a failed saving throw might mean that the ongoing damage continues until
either the attacker or the defender dies, (3) hit points don’t need to be the “measure” of the damage; it might be the character’s constitution score or some other number that’s used for the measurement, (4) the “vampire” might gain strength (probably hit points)
from draining a victim’s fluids, (5) if the attack involves a tube or some other physical connection, you might want to consider this
as an opportunity to add some interesting tactics to the battle – perhaps the tube has hit points and an armor class to allow the connection to be severed quickly, (6) perhaps the fluid is being replaced with something else like eggs or control-fluid.

34

Dexterity Loss. The attack drains one or more points of dexterity from the victim. The attacker may or may not gain a benefit
from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems to fit well with the concept. If the victim reaches a dexterity of 0, one of several things might happen: the victim might die and become a creature similar to the attacker
(this is common with undead, but a bit weird when dexterity is the attribute score being drained). One explanation for death at 0
dexterity is that the body’s internal systems (circulatory, etc) are no longer working in time with each other.

35

Dimensional (imprisonment). This type of attack imprisons the victim – to some degree – in another dimension or reality. This
can be interpreted a number of different ways. Perhaps suspended animation or catatonia can be caused by some sort of dimensional disjunction. Perhaps the imprisonment leaves an incorporeal echo on the material plane – and it might still be able to use
spells or mental powers. Perhaps the imprisonment’s only effect is to slow the victim’s movement rate (your feet are mired in one
dimension, but the rest of you is still free…).

36

Dimensional (phasing). This type of special attack taps other dimensions of time and space to screw around with the opposition’s
movement. The victim is affected with some type of dimensional movement (whether because of a disease, a poison, a curse, the
opening of a synchronicity with the eighth dimension, a coating of dimensional frictionlessness, or whatever). The effect is most
likely some sort of randomization of the victim’s movement, although it might also involve moving through solid substances (or
even being able to move faster through solids than through air).

37

Disease. The special attack causes a disease. Diseases can be fatal or non-fatal, can be quick-onset or slow-onset, and can cause all
kinds of different symptoms while the disease runs its course. Symptoms could include losing the ability to cast spells, a penalty
on saving throws or attack rolls, or whatever other interesting conditions you can dream up.

38

Drain Experience (experience points). The special attack causes the victim to lose experience points. Most likely, this is either
an undead creature or a creature that can affect the victim’s memory. A third possibility, related to memory, is a creature with some
ability to manipulate time or aging. Brain-creatures, leech-creatures, undead creatures, and dimensional creatures thus tend to be
the prime candidates for this sort of power. If you’ve got a good idea that falls outside those prime candidates, though, go for it.

39

Drain Experience (level). The special attack causes the victim to lose one (or possibly two) levels of experience. This is generally a feature of undead creatures that suck away the victim’s life energy (as opposed to creatures who affect memory, likely sucking away a set number of experience points rather than a level). A monster with this sort of level drain should be associated with
life (death) force in some way if it is not undead.

40

Electrical Damage (affects action). The attack causes electrical damage to the target, but there’s also a special effect involved
– if the victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc) he takes some action in response to or as a
result of the shock. Since electricity affects the brain, all kinds of actions are credible here – it’s a much broader set of possibilities
than what a fire attack might make someone do. Possibilities include: random actions for some number of rounds, loss of bodily
coordination (reflected with combat penalties), mental disorientation (affecting spell casting and possibly even in some really cool
ways like making the character risk casting the wrong spell), temporary paralysis, etc.

41

Electrical Damage (causes condition). In addition to the damage caused by the attack, there is a chance that the victim will also
have a “condition” lingering after the electrical shock. This is similar to electrical damage that causes an action, but bear with me
a moment. Possibilities include: the victim has a static charge built up that will cause damage to the next person he touches (not
good if you’re the cleric, but actually pretty cool if you’re the fighter and some of the enemies aren’t immune to electricity); the
victim cannot hold an object in his hands without dropping it; the victim is stunned, twitching, or knocked out from the electric
shock, etc.

112

BOOK TWO: MONSTERS — GENERAL MONSTER TABLES
Table 2-79: Special Attack Type Continued
Die Roll

Special Attack

42

Electrical Damage (hit or miss). The attack causes electrical damage, but a successful saving throw means that the target incurs
no damage. In other words, the saving throw functions as a to-hit roll and if it is successful the attack missed. Another way of
handling this is to require an attack roll for the attack itself (and then don’t allow a saving throw).

43

Electrical Damage (progressive). The victim takes electrical damage, but continues to take damage in later combat rounds until
the series of electrical shocks has run its course. Exactly what effect the continuing damage will have is up to you. It would
almost certainly prevent spell casting, but might also create penalties on saving throws, attack rolls, and/or movement rate.

44

Electrical Damage (save for half damage). The attack causes electrical damage, reduced by half with a successful saving throw.
In general, lightning or electrical attacks don’t have the same sort of “save or burn” collateral damage as fire attacks – or at least,
they’re not generally as severe. Electrical attacks are often made unique by the way the electricity moves around. Consider the
possibility of the electricity jumping from one target to another, the possibility of it reflecting off a wall or other surface.

45

Electricity (special). In this case, the electricity involved in the special attack isn’t normal electricity – it’s more of a special effect for something else. Just as magical fires can do all sorts of things rather than just burn, a strike of magical lightning or a bolt
of power can be the “visual candy” for a multitude of different sorts of attacks completely unrelated to real-world electricity. Possible effects include: lowering an ability score, acting randomly, suffering combat penalties, following enemy orders, floating up
into the air, losing the ability to act, losing the ability to cast spells, functioning as a lower-level character, running away, suffering
saving throw penalties, suffering hallucinations, and suffering from a heightened emotion such as rage or sorrow.

46

Elemental Vortex. The special attack creates (or animates) a whirlwind of air, fire, water, or earth. In each case, the attack causes
damage from a combination of smashing into the target plus the inherent properties of the element being used. Thus, fire would
cause additional fire damage, water might drown the victim, air might pick the victim up and move him around, and earth could
possibly suffocate the victim but is more likely just going to do more damage with the churning impact. More powerful monsters
might create vortices with more interesting results including collateral damage to equipment, moving the target a long way, pulling
the target down beneath the water or air, pulling the target into the elemental plane itself, stunning the target for some period of
time, causing the target to drop items, etc.

47

Emotion (despondency or sorrow). This special attack induces intense despondency or sorrow in the victim. As is the case with all
special attacks involving emotion, creating the details of the special attack is a two-step process concerning (1) who is affected and (2)
what happens when someone is affected. Here are some ideas about who might or might not be vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain
number of hit dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is
automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain races or classes may be
immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number might be automatically affected
or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly close to the monster (or the locus of the emotion-effect) have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain distance gets a bonus, (6) the effect begins as a very low chance but increases as
the combat progresses (a series of saving throws or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas for the effect of
despondency, consider the following: (1) immobilized with sorrow, regret, grief, or ennui; (2) all die rolls are made with a penalty, (3)
character departs to go and repair his miserable life, (4) character decides to end it all, and rolls an attack against himself, (5) character
blames someone else for his miserable condition, and attacks them instead of the monster, (6) character risks dropping dead from
melancholy. One interesting idea is that if the character escapes from this effect, he might be granted a bonus to attack the monster, in
revenge. Players adore it when a special attack gets turned around into a bonus for them.

48

Emotion (fear). The monster has a horrific appearance, changes into a horrific appearance, mentally induces fear, or has some
other way of causing fear. Fear can be portrayed in a number of different ways, in terms of the attack’s effect, and there are also
a number of different ways to determine who is vulnerable to the attack. Here are some ideas about who might or might not be
vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw,
(3) members of certain races or classes may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than
a certain number might be automatically affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly close to the monster (or the
locus of the fear-effect) have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain distance gets a bonus, (6)
the fear effect begins as a very low chance but increases as the combat progresses (a series of saving throws or some other “check”
with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas for the effect of fear, consider the following: (1) an ability score is vastly reduced until
the fear goes away, (2) those affected act randomly according to a table you prepare, (3) those affected suffer combat penalties to
hit and/or on damage, (4) those affected follow orders given by the source of fear, (5) those affected are paralyzed with fear, (6)
those affected function as a lower-level character, (7) running away (8) chance of death from fear.

49

Emotion (love or happiness). This special attack induces the emotion of love or happiness in the victim – probably directed
toward the monster using the special attack, but possibly as a way of immobilizing the target. As is the case with all special attacks involving emotion, creating the details of the special attack is a two-step process concerning (1) who is affected and (2) what
happens when someone is affected. Here are some ideas about who might or might not be vulnerable: (1) anyone under a certain
number of hit dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is
automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain races or classes may
be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number might be automatically
affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly close to the monster (or the locus of the emotion-effect) have a penalty
on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain distance gets a bonus, (6) the effect begins as a very low chance but
increases as the combat progresses (a series of saving throws or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As a list of ideas
for the effect of love/happiness, consider the following: (1) the victim drops everything to grovel before, speak poetry to, or praise
the monster (or some other focus including other characters or shiny objects), (2) the victim tries to assist and protect the monster,
(3) the victim changes sides and follows the monster’s orders.

Special Attack

Emotion (rage). This special attack induces rage, either by taunting, mental manipulation, or temporary insanity. As is the case
with all special attacks involving emotion, creating the details of the special attack is a two-step process concerning (1) who is
affected and (2) what happens when someone is affected. Here are some ideas about who might be vulnerable: (1) anyone under
a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number
of hit dice is automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain races
or classes may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number might be
automatically affected or might be immune, (5) those who are particularly near the monster (or the locus of the rage-effect) have
a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely, everyone beyond a certain distance gets a bonus, (6) the rage effect begins as a very
low chance but increases as the combat progresses (a series of saving throws or some other “check” with increasing penalties). As
a list of ideas for the effect of rage, consider the following: (1) victim attacks with melee weapons and cannot voluntarily retreat,
(2) the rage is a distraction, causing combat penalties and restricting spell casting, (3) the rage gives a bonus on one hand (damage
rolls, perhaps) but there is a more dangerous penalty associated with it as well, such as a penalty on saving throws, attack rolls,
inability to retreat, inability to do anything more subtle than a frontal assault, etc. (4) the rage is so fierce that the victim is actually paralyzed by it. It is possible that the “rage” is not automatically going to be directed at the monster using the special attack,
either: it might cause members of the party to attack each other, or it might be an “attack” that’s used to strengthen the monster’s
minions and allies (in which case, it might be a benefit with no particular downside, like a to-hit bonus).

51

Energy Vortex. Similar to the “Elemental Vortex,” this is an attack in which the monster calls forth a whirlwind of some kind of
“energy,” including electricity, magical force, or mental force. The victim would suffer damage, but the distinguishing feature of
this sort of attack is either that the victim is picked up and moved by the attack or is trapped inside it until he escapes or the duration expires (duration might be as long as the monster concentrates on maintaining the effect, which is not good for the victim).

52

Fire (special). In this case, the fire involved in the special attack isn’t normal fire – it’s more of a special effect for something else.
Magical fires can do all sorts of things rather than just burn, so this is a very broad category. Possible effects include: lowering an
ability score, acting randomly, suffering combat penalties, following enemy orders, floating up into the air, losing the ability to act,
losing the ability to cast spells, functioning as a lower-level character, running away, suffering saving throw penalties, suffering
hallucinations, and suffering from a heightened emotion such as rage or sorrow. The fire doesn’t have to be magical – it could just
be that this particular monster’s fire-breath causes people to flee, for instance. On the other hand, the whole “fire” thing might be
little more than a special effect for an attack that’s really all about floating the opponent helplessly into the air.

53

Fire Damage (affects action). The attack causes fire damage to the target, but there’s also a special effect involved – if the victim
fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc) he reflexively takes some action in response to the fire.
These could include: fleeing for a couple of combat rounds, trying to put out the fire, or writhing in pain.

54

Fire Damage (hit or miss). The attack causes fire damage, but a successful saving throw means that the target incurs no damage.
In other words, the saving throw functions as a to-hit roll and if it is successful the attack missed. Another way of handling this
is to require an attack roll for the attack itself (and then don’t allow a saving throw). Items in the area may take collateral damage
(a saving throw or a “hot” effect), but only if the target failed the saving throw – because if the target makes the saving throw, the
items were presumably not exposed to the fire in the first place.

55

Fire Damage (progressive). The victim takes fire damage, but continues to take damage in later combat rounds until the fire has
run its course. The attack is most likely made with a burning substance as opposed to a burst of flame – the monster spat burning
oil, phosphorus, Greek fire, napalm, or lots of burning coals – or some sort of magically lingering fire. It is the continued burning
of the substance that causes the ongoing damage. Exactly what effect the continuing damage will have is up to you. It would
almost certainly prevent spell casting, but might also create penalties on saving throws, attack rolls, and/or movement rate.

56

Fire Damage (save for half damage). The attack causes fire damage, reduced by half with a successful saving throw. Fire may
also cause collateral damage to items, depending on how “strong” you want the attack to be. If the fire causes collateral damage,
you could reflect this in a variety of ways: (1) require flammable items to make a saving throw or be ruined (or ignite), (2) decide
that certain items such as cloth will automatically – no saving throw – smolder (and cause damage to the wearer) unless time is
spent extinguishing them, (3) take into account that metal retains heat and build in some process to handle “hot” armor and weapons. The basic form of a fire attack, though, is simply to require a saving throw for vulnerable items – whether or not the target
took half damage because he made a saving throw.

57

Hallucinations or Illusions (basic). The special attack causes hallucinations or illusions for those who are affected. The illusions
might be bright colors, things that appear to be changing form, or whatever – what’s important isn’t the exact nature of the illusion
but the effect it has on general combat (more complicated illusions are treated in a different category). The easiest way to come
up with basic illusion/hallucination attacks is to determine first what they do, and then figure out what sort of illusion might create
that effect. Possible results of a basic hallucination are as follows: (1) lowering an ability score while the hallucination is operating, (2) acting randomly according to some table of actions, (3) suffering combat penalties to hit, (4) following enemy orders or
orders generated randomly by a sound-hallucination, (5) losing the ability to take any actions due to fascination, nausea, confusion,
etc, (6) functioning as a lower-level character as a general way of reflecting that the character is distracted, (7) running away or
moving randomly in response to the hallucinated reality, or (8) suffering saving throw penalties. As a basic example of thinking up
the illusion based on the result: a hallucination which causes an attack penalty of –2 might be an illusion which blurs the outlines
of the character’s sight or shifts his vision slightly to the side of where things actually are. In addition to the combat-type basic illusions, there is another category of basic “camouflage-type” illusions used by ambush-monsters – these illusions don’t necessarily
create any sort of combat modifier, but they make the monster seem innocuous until it is ready to attack or lead the party toward
some attractive-looking goal where the monster has an advantage. These would include monsters that are invisible, monsters that
can make themselves look like stone walls or statues, a monster that can make people think it’s a treasure chest, etc.

58

Hallucinations or Illusions (complex). The special attack causes a hallucination or illusion that is too complex to be characterized with a modifier to die rolls or a table of random actions. An illusion of mirror images (giving the monster’s opponents the
chance to be attacking the “wrong” monster) is one example; another example is a hallucination that might cause damage to the
victim, and a third example is a hallucination that creates the image of a deep pit between the monster and the victim. In general, these fall into the following categories: illusions that create false enemies, obscure or change the appearance of the enemies,
create illusionary obstacles, create illusionary dangers (the appearance of a spell being cast, fake attacks, or some other type of
illusionary assault), or otherwise prevent the victim from getting true information about the tactical situation. Exactly how these
are handled is up to you – if the illusion is unusual, you might choose not to follow the “official” method for handling illusions,
if your game has one. There is a wide variety of interesting ways to handle illusions, including saving throws, a “check” against
intelligence or wisdom, or simply telling the player what the character sees and leaving it to the player to respond. In some cases,
depending on the illusion, the way to handle it will be obvious; in other cases, the same illusion treated differently might as well
be a different kind of special attack. Feel free to let your imagination roam: what sort of illusion might you create if you were a
monster? One last point: there is a big difference between a monster that creates one specific illusion (mirror images, for example)
and one that can create all kinds of illusions in response to the circumstances. The latter type of monster is very powerful, and you
might want to think of its abilities in terms of spells rather than a general ability to create illusions.

59

Ice (blasting). This sort of attack is partially about the cold temperature, but there’s a “blasting” component to it as well. Such
effects could include: knocking the target backward, knocking the target prone, blowing items out of the target’s hands, etc.

60

Ice (immobilizing). This sort of attack isn’t all about the temperature; it will probably cause some hit point damage, but the main
feature of the attack is that it uses frozen water to immobilize the target. It might be creation of a block of ice (“it froze the air
itself!”), or it might be a matter of breathing a storm of ice particles that create a block, wall, or chunk. If the monster is very powerful or highly magical, the ice might have other dangerous properties – suffocation, ongoing damage, or a chance of instant death
from hypothermia all being possibilities.

61

Immobilize (by an activity). Although many of the special attacks listed here would have the effect of immobilizing the victim,
this entry addresses immobilization-type attacks as a group. Here is a series of activities which could cause a character to be effectively immobilized: dancing, twitching, laughing, vomiting, nausea, confusion, jumping, floating, talking, scratching, begging
for mercy, thinking, arguing, holding one’s breath, hiding, and meditating.

62

Implant Eggs or Young. This special attack implants the victim with eggs or larvae, or in some way makes him into a host for
the attacker’s reproduction – which can include a magical transformation into the same sort of creature (possibly independent, possibly a slave of the attacker). There are several possible variables to work with when designing this sort of special attack. First,
the trigger – it might be that a successful hit automatically begins the process, it might be that there is a saving throw required after
each hit, it might be that each hit has a percentage chance of causing the effect, or it might be that the “egg-laying” effect only happens when the victim is dead, knocked unconscious, or rendered helpless by the attack. Secondly, the remedy – the process would
be counteracted differently depending on whether the “eggs” are considered a poison, a curse, or a disease. Thirdly, the gestation
period – it might run from only a couple of combat rounds to more than a week in duration (giving the adventurers much more
time to find a remedy back in the civilized world). Fourthly, the effects during gestation – perhaps the victim remains unconscious
or in suspended animation until the eggs hatch (or his body alters, or the implanted creature eats its way out, or whatever), perhaps
he can wake up and function normally until his sudden demise as a character, or perhaps you can think of one or two “stages” of
the process in which the victim becomes weaker or changes as a result of being used as a host organism.

63

Insanity (strategic). “Strategic” insanity, as opposed to “tactical” insanity, is a form of insanity in which the effects aren’t
bundled up in the game rules, but are reflected in the roleplaying and in the non-combat side of the game. Examples include various phobias, aversions, and manias. Hysterical blindness is another good example – a condition that can suddenly appear when
the character is under stress.

64

Insanity and Confusion (tactical). The special attack drives the victim temporarily or permanently insane. The characteristic
example of this sort of attack is confusion, which causes victims to act according to a random table.

65

Intelligence Loss. The attack drains one or more points of intelligence from the victim. The attacker may or may not gain a benefit from the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems to fit well with the concept. If the
victim reaches an intelligence of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one of several things might happen: the victim might die and
become a creature similar to the attacker or become a mindless host for the attacker’s larval offspring (mind-leeches, or whatever).
Another possibility is that the victim just dies, and a third possibility is that restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might
have returned naturally is now a permanent condition requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might
be temporary or permanent – this is up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

66

Light, Dark, and Shadow. The monster uses light, darkness, or shadow as a special attack. Consider some of the following: (1)
a floating weapon or dangerous coalescence of light or darkness, which attacks once brought into being, (2) creates darkness to
effectively blind the enemy, (3) blasts of damaging light, (4) the monster can compress and concentrate light or darkness to make
some interesting form of attack.

67

Luck. This special attack gives the victim bad luck (reflected with die roll penalties). The question is: what sort of bad luck? Is
it just a curse that makes you inflict less damage, or is it a wide-ranging effect that doesn’t just make you miss opponents but also
means you always get a fly in your beer at the local tavern? In addition to whatever specific die roll modifier this attack causes,
some monsters might deliver bad luck in very specific categories: the beautiful woman type monster might deliver a curse of bad
luck with the opposite gender; the earth-elemental type monster might deliver bad luck involving gemstones; the dryad-like creature might give bad luck outdoors, or involving wooden items.

Special Attack

68

Magic Drain (items). The special attack drains magic items of their power (and might or might not give the monster additional
power as a result). Items can be drained temporarily or permanently, and they can also be drained in a way that gives them a
chance to fail when used as opposed to being completely “dead.”

69

Magic Drain (spells). The special attack removes, to some degree or other, a spell caster’s ability to cast spells. The attack might
remove a single spell from the caster’s mental inventory, it might remove all spells, it might remove particular spells, it might
remove spells of a certain level or higher (or lower), or it might lower the caster’s effective level of experience. Alternatively, the
attack might cause all the caster’s spells to function sub-normally, or create a chance of failure when the caster tries to cast a spell.
In the case of powerful monsters, draining spell power from a caster might also strengthen the monster; giving it extra hit dice,
hit points, or a combat bonus. In the case of extremely powerful monsters, whatever spell was drained might actually go to the
monster and give it the ability to cast that spell.

70

Magic or Mental Force (slam). The special attack uses magical force or telekinesis to smash the victim into something, or
smash something into the victim. This includes hitting the victim with magic force alone (i.e., no actual object). This is a broad
category: the attacker might or might not need to make a to-hit roll, and the defender might or might not have the chance to avoid
the blow with a saving throw or other means of lessening the damage. More powerful versions of this attack might do one or more
of the following: push back the victim, hurl back the victim, make the victim drop items in hand, stun the victim, knock the victim
unconscious, or even have a chance to kill the victim outright.

71

Memory (steal ability). This special attack allows the monster to use some ability or skill known by the target. The most obvious
example of this is casting a spell, but combat bonuses or other advantages could be targeted by such an attack. Even the victim’s
target number for saving throws, for example, could be “stolen” if it is more favorable than the monster’s normal target number.
It is also possible for a memory-affecting special attack to target only the magically related memories of a target, stripping away
spells or spell casting abilities but leaving combat and other skills unaffected. This more specific type of memory attack would
generally be found in creatures with some relation to wizardly magic (e.g., created in a wizard’s lab, bred to fight wizards, etc), a
relation to divine or unholy power (e.g., the monster is a remnant of some ancient divine retribution, is a parasite of divine power,
etc), or feeds specifically on magic power.

72

Memory Drain (experience). Memory-draining special attacks are generally targeted at the victim’s level or experience points.
The attack would either remove (temporarily or permanently, depending on how you decide to design it) one or two levels of experience or a set number of experience points.

73

Movement Inhibited (external). Some sort of very weak binding or entangling inhibits the victim’s movements. Victim suffers
one or more of the following: a penalty to hit, a penalty to armor class, and/or reduction in spell casting ability (perhaps only
“easy” spells, perhaps a chance of spell failure, perhaps an increase in casting time). There is probably also some reduction in the
victim’s movement rate. The nature of the binding force can include: filaments of magical energy, thickened air, vacuum power or
wind, clothing becoming brittle or cumbersome, etc.

74

Movement Prevented (external). Some sort of binding or entangling prevents the victim from moving. The severity of the attack can range from complete helplessness to merely being held in one place (but otherwise able to take actions). The nature of
the binding force can include: filaments of magical energy, thickened air, a coagulated blob of magical glue, a natural adhesive,
swarms of infinitesimal spirits holding the victim in place, the stones of the floor grabbing his ankles, a spider web, or animated
vines or tentacles.

75

Open Planar Gate. The monster can open a gate into some other reality. This could be an escape mechanism, a way of summoning allies, or a way of blasting the area with weirdness from the other plane. Even a fairly mundane little mole-like critter becomes
interesting if it can burrow into the tenth dimension and come out behind you. Indeed, if it can open a gate through time, it might
be able to come out and attack you simultaneously from two different places (of course, then it would disappear for a few moments
since it used itself as a special attack a few moments earlier…). If a planar gate is used to summon allies (again, keep in mind that
even minor monsters – like a planar ant – might be able to summon more of their own kind). If the gate is an escape mechanism,
perhaps it’s possible for the adventurers to follow the monster into some strange and alien realm where it makes its home – and
possibly has a different bodily form.

76

Paralysis. The special attack causes paralysis for a random number of combat rounds, minutes, or hours. A very powerful monster might cause permanent paralysis as a form of curse, poison, or disease.

77

Poison (lethal). Lethal poisons cause death, but death is not necessarily immediate. A slow-onset poison might cause some sort of
debilitating effects during the onset period (such as the victim being incapacitated with pain, or becoming unconscious), or it might
simply cause a progressive weakness that isn’t reflected in terms of the game’s numbers… until the character drops dead.

78

Poison (non-lethal). Non-lethal poisons can have a variety of effects: some might be temporary effects until the effects of the poison have worn off, but others might be permanent debilities until some sort of magic has been used to reverse the damage caused
by the poison.

79

Raise, Create, or Summon Undead. Undead monsters aren’t the only ones who can use undead monsters as allies or minions.
More importantly, not all undead must necessarily be undead – a statement which obviously requires clarification. Animated bodies need not be the result of black magic (which is the case for, say, the standard zombie). But what about bodies animated or controlled by a plant – is this technically an undead zombie? Will it necessarily work in exactly the same way as an undead zombie
just because it’s a moving human corpse? If your answer is “no,” then you’ve just opened up the realm of the plant-undead, the
virally-controlled undead, the mechanically-controlled undead, the psionically-controlled undead … all kinds of creepy minions
and transformations that can be used to develop monsters and their abilities.

Special Attack

80

Senses (overstimulate). The five senses are sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell, and each of them could be overstimulated by a
monster by means of a special attack. I don’t necessarily mean that the monster is hideously ugly, sounds awful, feels awful, tastes
awful or smells awful, although if one of those trips off an inspiration, then run with it. What’s meant here is that the monster
affects one of the victim’s senses to make it too powerful for effective use. For example, if the special attack affects the victim’s
sense of smell, all smells might become so powerful that the victim falls prey to nausea. If the attack affects sight, the victim
might be overcome by light sensitivity or have vision so microscopic that he can’t perceive what’s happening around him. Since
there is a wide variety of possibly “effects” stemming from sensory overstimulation, here is a quick list of possibilities to get the
mind working: (1) temporarily lowering an ability score (or all ability scores), (2) acting randomly, (3) suffering combat penalties,
(4) losing the ability to act due to nausea, fascination, or confusion, (5) functioning as a lower-level character, (6) running away or
moving randomly, (7) suffering saving throw penalties, (8) dropping any items held in hand.

81

Senses (remove capability). The five senses are sight, hearing, touch, taste, and smell. Only sight and hearing have much effect
in game terms, so I’ve just lumped them all together into one entry on this table. The special attack causes blindness (or makes
lots of things invisible), or it causes deafness (or keeps sound from functioning in the are) – alternatively, it removes the sense of
touch, taste or smell from the target (or negates feeling, taste or smells within the area of effect).

82

Size and Density. The special attack changes the size or density of the victim (and a beneficial form of it might also be usable to
help allies if the monster is a leader-type). Growing and shrinking allies and enemies respectively is a fairly obvious use of this
sort of ability, and it’s easy to generate a set of modifiers as required. Manipulating density and weight is a bit more open ended.
Can the monster make people weightless so they can levitate or be levitated? How about too heavy to move? Perhaps the effect
only works on metal or some other substance.

83

Sleep and Catatonia. The special attack causes magical sleep, normal sleep, catatonia, or suspended animation. In some cases
the effect might be automatic against targets with a lower number of hit dice (or levels), or it might permit a saving throw. It could
also affect only those with intelligence or wisdom lower than a target number, or affect only a certain total number of hit dice
within an area. Onset is probably immediate, but it would also be possible that there’s an intermediate, “sleepy” phase in which
the victim is still functioning with combat penalties before actually falling into the magical sleep. Powerful sleep-type attacks
might induce this “sleepy” condition even if the victim makes a successful saving throw. In some cases, particular dreams, or
dreams sent by the attacker, might be an important part of the attack in addition to putting the victim to sleep.

84

Slow. This sort of special attack slows down the victim, probably to half speed at everything, but possibly only in terms of movement or attack speed – it depends on how the monster does it. The effect might just be magic which slows down opponents, it
might be related to manipulation of time or other dimensions, or it might be that the monster produces an external cause like glue
or webs that slow people down.

85

Sound (action-causing). The monster speaks or makes sounds that compel certain actions in the unfortunate listener. This isn’t
control by the monster, because the monster can’t fine-tune anything, but in many ways the effect is the same. Examples include:
approaching the monster, becoming paralyzed, running away, removing armor, attacking, hiding, etc.

86

Sound (control). Many folkloric monsters use sound to control others – whether by means of song, speech, or spell. There are
many ways to represent different degrees of mental control, and many ways to determine whether a person is affected. For example, degrees of mental control include: (1) victim follows all commands like a puppet, (2) victim sees the controller as his friend
but will not put himself into mortal danger, (3) controller can only command the victim to perform certain actions, but other actions don’t fall within the scope of the magic – for example, a monster that can “call” the victim to a certain place, but can’t order
the victim to attack its enemies. In terms of ways to determine if a target is affected, here is another list of possibilities: (1) anyone
under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected but those of higher level are at no risk, (2) anyone under a certain number of hit dice is automatically affected and those of higher level are affected if they fail a saving throw, (3) members of certain
races or classes may be immune or might be particularly vulnerable, (4) anyone with intelligence less than a certain number might
be automatically affected or might be immune, depending on the nature of the sound/persuasion being used, (5) anyone within
hearing gets a saving throw, (6) those who are particularly close to the sound have a penalty on the saving throw, or, conversely,
everyone beyond a certain distance gets a bonus. The duration of sound-control attacks is another factor that can be used to create
different types of challenges: in some cases, the control might end as soon as the sound ends, but in other cases the control might
be established irrevocably.

87

Sound (distraction). The monster uses speech, sound, or song to distract or immobilize its enemies. It may be that the sound
itself is so discordant or so beautiful that it creates the distraction, or it could be that the sound evokes such a strong emotional
response that the victim acts strangely or fights poorly. To run through these variables: if the sound or speech evokes an emotion, these could include joy, rage, hate, greed, fear, or adoration. The effects of such sound attacks could include: (1) temporarily
lowering an ability score, (2) acting randomly, (3) suffering combat penalties, (4) following enemy orders, (5) losing the ability
to act, (6) losing the ability to cast spells, (7) functioning as a lower-level character, (8) running away, (9) suffering saving throw
penalties, (10) suffering hallucinations – or a combination of more than one of the above.

88

Sound Damage (save for half damage). Sonic damage is a little hokey, but every once in a while it works (particularly with
monsters based on real-world animals that use echolocation or are known for producing a characteristic sound. Sonic damage
ordinarily wouldn’t cause collateral damage to items or equipment, but glass is a natural candidate for being damaged in this way.
I recommend avoiding the concept of sonic damage – sound works much better for mental control, combat penalties, preventing
spell casting, and other such special effects than it does with the concept of taking actual hit point damage. At all costs, avoid
thinking of sound damage in terms of vibration and frequency, and start thinking of it in terms of song and screech – or you’ll
make a serious misstep in terms of the “feel” of a fantasy game. This is even true if the monster is from the “voids between the
stars” or from an alternate high-tech universe.

89

Spell-like Abilities. The monster has a set group of abilities that function as spells, probably with a limited number of castings
per day, per hour, per minute, or whatever. Unlike true spells, it may be that all monsters of this type have exactly the same spelllike abilities and can’t change them from day to day (to my mind, this is what distinguishes “spell-like” from “spell,” but what’s
important here isn’t to create clean categories, it’s to muddle things together for maximum creative boost). Spell like abilities are
normally, but not necessarily, best when all the abilities are obviously related to something about the monster. A monster from the
elemental plane of fire should have mostly fire type abilities, and (interestingly) it is the non-fire abilities that will tend to make it
stand out in the players’ minds. If a fire-genie has several fire abilities but can also use mind-control, that’s very distinctive. But if
it has too many non fire-related abilities, it may fail to be memorable.

90

Spells. The monster uses spells, or can use its special attack to deliver spells from a list identical to a magic-user of some defined
level. Different monsters of the same type might have a different “selection” of spells.

91

Strange Chemical (affects items). The special attack releases or creates a chemical that affects non-living substances. The affected substance might be wood, leather, paper, fires, metal, water, air, potions, magical ink, hair – the choices are pretty wideranging. The chemical reaction either destroys the substance, makes it multiply, or changes it into something else – and the
interesting part might be the side effect of the reaction, too. Many chemical reactions give off energy, suck energy out of the air,
create gases, and do all kinds of strange things. Most likely, the chemical reaction will change the liquid/gas/solid composition of
a substance, or change it into another form (iron to rust, leather to powder, wood to stone, etc).

92

Strange Chemical (affects person). The attack creates a chemical reaction of some kind – either the chemical is sprayed onto the
victim or the attacker’s gaze causes chemicals in the victim’s body to change, or whatever. This is a huge category of possibilities, because a “chemical reaction” can explain any result whatsoever, especially if you throw in words like “enzymes,” and even
more especially if the monster is from another plane of existence, another time, or from the “voids between the worlds.” On the
other hand, traditionally folkloric monsters like griffons or dragons shouldn’t have quasi-scientific explanations for what they do
– use magic. Quasi-science is best for weirder monsters. Possibilities for strange chemical reactions include: lowering an ability
score, acting randomly, suffering combat penalties, following enemy orders, floating up into the air, losing the ability to act, losing
the ability to cast spells, functioning as a lower-level character, running away, suffering saving throw penalties, suffering hallucinations, and suffering from a heightened emotion such as rage or sorrow. Another way of looking at it is to think in terms of
transformations: these could include skin turning into metal (or getting crusted with metal), gases that might be given off, medical
symptoms (hemophilia), and factors such as weight, density, friction, adhesion, or release of energy.

93

Strength Loss. The attack drains one or more points of strength from the victim. The attacker may or may not gain a benefit from
the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems to fit well with the concept. If the victim
reaches a strength score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one of several things might happen: the victim might die and become
a creature similar to the attacker, might just die, or might just lose the ability to naturally restore the lost strength points. Note that
the drain might be temporary or permanent – this is up to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

94

Stun. The attack uses some kind of “special effect” to stun its victims. Possibilities include noise, electric shock, an ugly appearance, mystical rays, visions of the future, hallucinations, powerful emotions, a floating symbol, light, and the old standby … a
powerful physical impact.

95

Stupidity. The victim does not actually lose points of intelligence or wisdom, but his thinking is impaired enough to cause penalties on various actions. Spell casting is probably prevented entirely, but a weak version of this sort of attack might only prevent
casting “harder” spells – or all spell casting might be subject to a chance of failure. This sort of attack could also lead to combat
penalties: inability to use both a weapon and a shield at the same time, perhaps a to-hit penalty, etc. The way in which the attack
causes stupidity could include distraction by overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction (mysterious chemicals in the creature’s spittle); the aftereffects of an electrical shock; some sort of mental numbing;
sapping away the thoughts themselves; or a very weak poison, curse, or disease. The duration could range from only a couple of
combat rounds to days in length.

96

Telekinesis and Teleportation. These special attacks are used to move enemies into bad places and smack them with things.
Powerful monsters will be able to use the power more flexibly: for example, a brain-lord might be able to choose how far and
when he wants to teleport himself of a target, but a brain-munchkin might teleport a specific distance at random intervals with no
ability to teleport an enemy at all.

97

Transformation (basic polymorph). The special attack turns the victim into an animal or some other form (such as an object).
Stronger, smarter, or more magical creatures might have the ability to choose what form they will polymorph victims into, while
other monsters might only have the ability to turn people specifically into frogs. The duration of the transformation is fairly
important – does it end when the attacker is killed, does it end after a set duration, or is it permanent? Another consideration
is whether the victim retains his own mind (and the player if left controlling a rabbit) or whether the change is more than just a
change in outer form. In some cases, the attack might be part of a one-two punch; if the monster controls all wolves, and can turn
people into wolves, the attack can be used to turn enemies into allies – giving the other party members the dilemma of whether to
attack their polymorphed-and-controlled ally.

98

Transformation (basic substance). This special attack changes one substance into another or changes the state of matter. (See
Table 2-81)

99

Weakness. Victim suffers one or more of the following: a penalty to hit, a penalty to damage, and/or the chance to drop any items
he is holding. Actual strength score is not necessarily affected. The way in which the attack causes weakness could include overloading one of the victim’s emotions (joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction (mysterious chemicals in the creature’s
spittle); the aftereffects of an electrical shock; sapping of willpower; or a very weak poison, curse, or disease. The duration could
range from only a couple of combat rounds to days in length.

Wisdom Loss. The attack drains one or more points of wisdom from the victim. The attacker may or may not gain a benefit from
the drain (additional hit points, to-hit bonuses, etc) depending upon whether it seems to fit well with the concept. If the victim
reaches a wisdom score of 0 as a result of successive attacks, one of several things might happen: the victim might die and become
a creature similar to the attacker, or might remain alive as the attacker’s mental slave. Another possibility is that the victim just
dies, and a third possibility is that restoring the lost points becomes harder – what might have returned naturally is now a permanent condition requiring spells or divine intervention to reverse. Note that the drain might be temporary or permanent – this is up
to you as a matter of how powerful you want the monster to be.

Table 2-84: Morphological Changes & Phases (Reproductive Cycles)
Die Roll

Nature of Cycle

01-10

Egg-laying mating type transforms into warriors or
workers in an ongoing, non-seasonal cycle. It happens
all the time so that there is a constant supply of eggs,
egg-layers, warriors, and workers at all times.

11-20

Eggs are laid on land by predominantly aquatic creature,
hatch into a feeding-type that lives on land until it transforms into a predominantly aquatic creature that mates
in water but lays the eggs on land.

21-30

First phase is a larval eater, and it cocoons or transforms
into a traveler-mating form that lays eggs.

31-40

First phase is a swimmer form, which cocoons or transforms into a land-based hunter or grazer which mates
and lays eggs (in water).

41-50

First phase is egg-layer, eggs hatch into food-finder,
food-finder transforms into mating form (traveler and
possibly fighter for mates), mating form transforms into
egg-layer.

51-60

First phase is egg-layer, second phase combines foodfinder, warrior, and mating form, second phase cocoons
or otherwise transforms into the egg-layer type.

61-70

First phase is the egg-layer, second phase is made up
of three separate morphological forms: food finders,
warriors, and mating form of one gender. Warriors
transform into egg-layers in the right season, providing
the other gender for the mating form to compete over.

Die Roll

Nature of Cycle

71-80

First phase is the egg-layer, second phase is made up of
two morphological types; neuter workers and a hermaphrodite warrior-mating form. These warriors probably fight a lot, since otherwise a hermaphrodite form
would create lots of population. A failure of this fighting
cycle could lead to a horde forming, which could be a
nice adventure hook. Perhaps the hordes are periodic,
too.

81-90

Hermaphrodite form lays eggs and then dies; half the
eggs hatch into a traveler-defender form that goes out to
build nests for the other half of the eggs. Second half of
the clutch hatches into more hermaphrodite egg-layers.

91-00

Mating form lays eggs and dies; eggs hatch into a traveler-defender form which goes out to build new nests or
hives, then cocoons or transforms into the mating form.
One gender probably builds nests, and the other gender
probably picks nice nests and fights over them in competition (health, fighting ability, plumage, etc). Genders
might look utterly different, here.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN

Introduction to Book Three
The previous two books of this series contain tables that are designed to spark ideas: the first book addressed missions and villainous plans, and
the second book focuses on monsters. This third book, on the other hand, takes for granted that you have already chosen the starting point of a
subterranean setting, and provides a vast array of tables designed for this specific type of adventure. Part One addresses certain general elements
that are key to any adventure, subterranean or not, and the remainder of the book is specifically about adventures in the dark depths of the earth.
mishmash on the chalkboard or easel or whatever. This is the point
in the adventure-design process where you will start to get flashes of
visual imagery, and notice that certain elements of the mix contain interesting themes.

Creative Overload
At the beginning of Lewis Carroll’s “Jabberwocky,” everything is unformed; nonsense words crowd upon the reader
to form inchoate images. It’s brillig, we know, and there’s a
mishmash of undefined activity – slithy toves are gyring and
gimbling all over the place, or at least in the wabe, possibly
elsewhere. Mome raths are outgrabing, apparently independent
of all the action at the wabe. The borogoves are in a state of
mimsiness. The reader is in a state of confusion. This part of
the poem corresponds to creative overload, and Lewis Carroll
is doing it on purpose, just as I do in this book.

Creative Synthesis
In the next stanza of the Jabberwocky, a theme begins to develop. There is a father, a son; threats to their well-being have
surfaced to disturb this otherwise brillig place. There are one
or more jubjub birds, a wandering bandersnatch, and above all,
the Jabberwocky. No wonder the borogoves mimse; wouldn’t
you?

The Creative Process
There are four general steps in the creative process of designing
a dungeon adventure using this book. Don’t try to follow them as a
checklist, but it’s useful not to go into the process completely blind,
especially when your brain starts to hurt. The steps are:

Creative Overload

When you start using the tables in this book you will immediately encounter “overload,” a ridiculous mishmash of adjectives and concepts
that contradict each other, sound stupid, and pile upon each other in an
excess of details. This is actually a vital step in the creative process.
Somewhere in your life you have probably encountered the institution
of the “Brainstorming Session.” The idea of a brainstorming session is
to get several people together with a chalkboard, easel, or some other
way of writing down ideas where everyone in the group can see them.
The leader of the group poses whatever problem or objective the group
is supposed to handle, and starts taking ideas. No idea is too far-fetched,
no idea is stupid, no idea is impractical – at least, not at this point. This
phase of a brainstorming session corresponds to the overload of stories,
adjectives, names, and concepts generated by using the tables in this
book. As an adventure designer, you don’t have a creative team to sit
down and generate a host of ideas – you have to do it alone. This book
provides the equivalent of the creative team, tossing a multiplicity of
ideas into the mix without any particular rhyme or reason. Creative
overload is often mentally uncomfortable; it pushes beyond the normal
limits of what the mind can easily hold at one time. How we suffer for
our art. This is the point where you have a dungeon with one name, a
level of the dungeon with another name, a part of that level with yet
another name, plus a load of items and architectural elements with long
strings of adjectives attached to each and every one. Not only that, but
most of the adjectives are vague or even ambiguous.
Because I designed them that way.

Sculpting
Now you begin the process of working your way back into the mental
comfort zone by chopping out what doesn’t connect with the themes
that began appearing as you synthesized and assimilated the original
welter of ideas. Here’s the problem: you’ve got a massive pile of adjectives to describe things. Here’s the tool: themes and visual images have
started to appear in your creative mind … although some of them may
be mutually exclusive. A particular annoyance is that there might even
be two separate adventures floating around in your head at this point,
two different interpretations of the soup of ideas. Here, at last, is the solution: begin changing the vague “names” of things into mere descriptions. “Zar’s Inimitable Red Throne of Nothingness and Traps” gets
snipped into “The Red Throne,” and it’s got a trap that disintegrates
(into “nothingness”) anyone who sits in it. Zar is the wizard responsible for this bad-idea piece of home furnishing. Scrap “inimitable,”
because you’ve already got what you need. Here’s a different take on
the throne, though. What if it was a project, not an item? Maybe it’s part
of the backstory, Zar’s effort to imitate a throne he’d seen described in
an ancient book? Hey, maybe it’s a red book, and the trap isn’t about
the physical throne, it’s about the book. Put some of Zar’s journals into
the dungeon for the players to find, describe a storehouse full of trap
components the characters can use against monsters, and you’re ready
to rock along a completely different direction. Ambiguity is your volleyball: toss it around before you spike it into the court.

Synthesis

This is the next step in the creative process, and it’s a bit more comfortable than the process of deliberately overloading your mind with a
babble of concepts and images, but not much. In the traditional brainstorming session, the synthesis phase isn’t a group experience; each
individual in the group starts to gather strange threads of ideas, little
connections between some elements of the “there are no stupid ideas”

127

Sculpting
In the third, fourth, and fifth stanzas of the Jabberwocky, the
initial mishmash of the first stanza gets resolved into a thread
of purpose and action – even a bit more geography, although
the exact location of the tumtum tree relative to the wabe is
… vague at best. Still, two points define a line, so the geometricians will be comfortable even if the cartographers remain
deeply unsatisfied. And a line gives you a direction. Position
yourself at a point on that line (don’t use a tumtum tree – it’s
been done), do a bit of uffish thought, and then it’s time to take
your vorpal sword and begin cutting out what doesn’t belong.
Snicker-snack, and we are on to the next phase.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN

Building
Now that you have pared things down from the Cthulhuesque welter
of ultimate chaos, you will find that an adventure is beginning to take
shape in your mind, like a partially completed jigsaw puzzle. By culling out the parts that didn’t fit, you’ve opened up some gaps. But at
this point, you’ll start getting some very clear, precise ideas about how
to fill in the gaps. The creative process is opened up! Suddenly – and I
promise this – you will find that you are coming up with great ideas of
your own, sparked by the initial chaos but completely novel. Now you
are in the most comfortable and productive mental space, firing on all
cylinders. You’re in the zone.

To summarize, this book is an immense Jabberwockatorium, in
which you can choose to gimble about in one or more specific parts, or
through which you can galumph toward a well-defined objective. The
choice is yours.

“The DM will have to respond
to superior play by extending
himself or herself to pose
bigger and better problems
for the party to solve.”

								

Building

-Gary Gygax, 1978

In the final stanza of the “Jabberwocky,” Lewis Carroll wraps
it all up. You’ve got a gleeful father, a son who’s triumphant
enough to do a bit of galumphing, and, all told, it’s a pretty
damn frabjous day. The nonsense words fit, now, and the reader
can figure them out. From the perspective of the reader, the
poem now sculpts itself backward into a story. In retrospect, the
nonsense all makes sense. The poem is finished, bringing order
out of chaos. From your perspective as an adventure designer,
you’re working on something that’s structurally a bit different
from a poem, since our task here is more open-ended. For instance, there might be a conspiracy of drow behind the slithy
tove incursion …

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - BASIC ELEMENTS OF ADVENTURE DESIGN

Part One: Basic Elements
Of Adventure Design
Book One has already introduced a series of broadly stated elements
for a masterpiece adventure, creating a sort of checklist (see the Side
Box). This section, down here all the way in Book Three, is about “how
to build,” not “what to end up with,” so it has a different set of factors. The Book Three approach reflects the fact that all the elements
described in Book One are actually, in practice, all mixed up together
when it comes to creating them. They only resolve themselves into
nice, neat, categories once the process is finished and the results are
polished up.

Elements of the Adventure
The Book One Approach
1) Backstory
2) Location
3) Opposition
4) Variation of Challenge
5) Exploration
6) Race Against Time
7) Resource Management
8) Milestones and Conclusions
9) Continuation Options

The Book Three Approach
1) The Time Element: some sort of race against time, possibly
a major factor, possibly a minor factor
2) The Motivational Element: what makes the players choose
this adventure
3) The Information Element: what do the players start out
knowing, what do they learn while adventuring that can help
them, and what previously unknown thing have they learned
at the end
4) The Tactical Element: what sorts of physical features are the
memorable “standouts” in the adventure, and how can the players use these to their advantage
5) The Monstrous Element: who or what is actively fighting
back?
6) The Movement Element: is your map well designed as a
game board?
7) The Miscellaneous Element: other types of challenges

Overview of the Basic
Adventure Elements
Certain elements appear in every good adventure, and if one of them is
lacking, you have missed an opportunity. Most adventures focus more
heavily on some elements than others, and the different emphasis of one
element over another can create highly distinct adventures. However,
each element is a dimension that should not be entirely omitted, even
from an adventure that is dominated by another element. For example,
an adventure designed to be a high-tension race against time will still
suffer if the combats don’t contain interesting tactical elements. An adventure that focuses on an extremely creative new monster will still
suffer if it takes place on a boring map. Keep these in mind while designing the adventure, and use them as a checklist after you’re done, because some degree of attention should be paid to each of these factors:
The Time Element: some sort of race against time, possibly a major
factor, possibly a minor factor
The Motivational Element: what makes the players choose this adventure
The Information Element: what do the players start out knowing,
what do they learn while adventuring that can help them, and what previously unknown thing have they learned at the end
The Tactical Element: what sorts of physical features are the memorable “standouts” in the adventure, and how can the players use these
to their advantage
The Monstrous Element: who or what is actively fighting back?
The Movement Element: is your map well designed as a game
board?
The Miscellaneous Element: other types of challenges

The Time Element:
Racing Against Time
The most important feature of any adventure is the race against time.
Virtually all good adventures contain some sort of race against time,
although the degree to which the race against time is a feature of the
adventure can vary quite a bit. In a lair-type adventure, a pressing race
against time can be used to prevent the adventure from dragging. On the
other hand, in a mega-dungeon where player choice is at its maximum,
the race against time might be little more than limitations on food and
light, hit points and spells. Every delay to check for secret doors or
inspect areas for potential traps increases the risk that the adventurers
will be attacked and weakened by wandering monsters before they can
find one of the dungeon’s treasure hoards, but the pressure of a rescue
or a villain’s plan coming to fruition isn’t used to create any further time
constraint. All these elements; the traps, the secret doors, the wandering monsters, and the treasure hoards come together to create a low level of time pressure that keeps things moving without building tension to
a high level. Both methods of structuring the pace of an adventure can

129

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - BASIC ELEMENTS OF ADVENTURE DESIGN
create an enjoyable gaming session.
It is worth noting that one adventure type reverses the “race against
time” concept, and that is the “hold out for reinforcements” type of
adventure in which the characters are under a siege of some kind but
can expect help if they can hold out long enough. In this case, it is the
monsters, rather than the players, who are faced with the adventure’s
underlying race against time.

Table 3-1: Types of Races Against Time
Die Roll

Nature of Race

Die Roll

Nature of Race

01-04

An item held by the party (e.g., a magic staff) or a protective spell loses power as time passes

53-56

Prisoner may be killed by kidnappers

57-60

05-08

A villainous plot will come to fruition shortly unless the
players can stop it from happening (the volcano erupting,
or the rain of fire starting, as examples)

Ransom is being increased for prisoner or kidnap victim
over time

61-64

Reward is predicated on success by a certain time

65-68

Reward is reduced with every day spent

69-72

Snowfall, sandstorm, or avalanche will prevent access to
adventure location after a particular time

73-76

Specific valuable treasure will be destroyed at a specific
time (sacrificed, for example)

77-80

The ability to enter and leave the dungeon or adventure
area will become more difficult after a certain time
period elapses (as opposed to closing entirely)

81-84

The characters have an ally or information source who
will be discovered or shut down after a certain period of
time (a traitor in the bandit stronghold who will certainly
be discovered soon, for example)

85-88

The characters will be discovered or identified in a
certain (probably unknown) period of time and they
must work quickly to obtain their objectives before this
happens

89-92

The characters’ basic provisions (or their air) will run out
– desert adventures where water supplies are limited are
a classic example.

93-96

The party’s patron suffers from a condition that will kill
him, transform him, or make him unable to pay the party
if too much time passes

09-12

Another group of adventurers is racing for the same
prize, reward, or achievement as the party

13-16

Crops will fail if solution is not found

17-20

Environmental conditions in the area are becoming more
dangerous as time passes (hotter, more smoke, water
rising, etc)

21-24

Income tax on the characters’ prospective treasure increases (as a percentage) over time

25-28

Living expenses are very high

29-32

Monsters are building or creating a powerful weapon
(probably magical, but possibly something like a siege
engine that must be taken out)

33-36

Monsters or opponents receive reinforcements as adventure proceeds

37-40

Monsters will change to more powerful form at a certain
time

41-44

Monsters will receive large reinforcements at a certain
time

45-48

One of the characters or an NPC working with the party
suffers from a disease, poison, or curse that takes hold or
has an increased effect as time passes. Avoiding lycanthropy, getting to a cleric before a body is too long dead to
be raised, and other such situations are good examples.

49-52

Prisoner may be executed by justice system

130

97-00

Treasure is something that deteriorates or drops in value
over time

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - BASIC ELEMENTS OF ADVENTURE DESIGN

The Motivational Element: “Selling” the Adventure to the Party
Another very important factor in all adventures is making the players want to undertake the adventure. Unless you want your campaign
to be an endless series of situations in which the characters are forced
into adventure after adventure dint of blackmail, high-handed kings,
and other “railroading” devices, you will need to entice the players
into choosing the “prepared” adventure of their own free will. Good
refereeing is a matter of letting the players choose their courses of
action, but that doesn’t mean you can’t dangle the carrot in front of
them to nudge them toward the adventures you’ve planned. Your adventures should be posed as opportunities, not necessities. Of course,
every rule is made to be broken from time to time, but in general
you should think about two things: (1) the players should see – and

you have to communicate – the opportunity for a dramatic, interesting
good time, and (2) you should play to the ever-present player motivations of experience and gold, which are the underlying forces of motivation embodied in the game rules; or to the desire for fame or moral
achievement, which might or might not be important factors to your
individual players. Make sure that the players can see and perceive
the adventure as an opportunity to gain fame, fortune, and buckets of
gold for their characters. They’ll take the bait every time.
Table 3-2 lists several “carrots” that can be offered by the adventure – or unusual awards that might be gained whether or not they
were revealed as possibilities to the players before the start of the
adventure.

The Information Element

The Tactical Element

A good adventure begins with snippets of information the players can
use, should provide both useful and useless clues in the middle of the
adventure, and conclude with (or develop as the adventure progresses)
some sort of “revelation” that most people don’t know. The revelation
doesn’t have to be anything earth-shattering; it could be as simple as
the fact that the monsters came into this area because there is a famine
in their normal hunting grounds. In many cases, the revelation is either
why the area became dangerous (see Tables 3-6, 3-7, 3-8 and 3-9 for
ideas) or the fact that the monsters are actually in the service of some
greater threat. In many cases, the revelation of this underlying mystery
may be the starter knowledge for another adventure if the players decide to act upon it, but this isn’t necessary and can actually begin to feel
formulaic if the “new adventure hook” becomes a standard feature of
each and every one of your adventures, session after session.

Certain types of challenges are common to all adventures, whether
wilderness or subterranean. The table below can be used for minor
challenges (similar to solving a trap or trick) but they can also be used
to get ideas for the sorts of large challenges that define a mission. For
instance, the entry “close” on the table might be used as the solution for
a minor trick, or it might spark the idea of closing a planar gate that has
been unfortunately or untimely opened.
Every adventure should have at least a couple of real showcase locations, but these aren’t necessarily tactical. They might be something
that’s just visually striking, or a really interesting “boss” monster, or
a mental challenge. Even if it’s not one of the showcase locations,
though, an adventure should contain at least one area where pure skill
on the part of the players has a huge effect on the outcome of a combat
there.

Tactical Situations
Tactical situations are built mainly upon the premise of getting yourself into the best position to gain an advantage. A more subtle use of
tactics is not only to place yourself to best advantage, but also to push
the enemy into a position of disadvantage. Forcing the enemy into a
particular location is not well represented in most rules, however.

Die Roll

Nature of Tactical Setup

10-12

Balconies and stairs: flight and falling objects come
into play as tactical features, along with controlling the
access to these areas

13-15

Periodic (random) hazards at predictable places: lava
fountains or rising spikes make certain areas dangerous
at random intervals

16-18

Periodic (predictable) hazards at predictable places:
lava fountains or rising spikes make certain areas dangerous at exact, predictable intervals

19-21

Major hazard at a particular point, surrounded by area
of high risk and reward: this might include a “brainstone” that requires anyone within ten feet to make a
saving throw or fall into babbling idiocy for several
hours – but anyone making the saving throw gains a
major bonus on to-hit rolls, or can “see” what the enemy is doing through their own eyes for several hours.
Getting to it first would provide a major advantage.
This sort of tactical goal allows the players to make
significant decisions that can affect the outcome in
unusual ways; should they take the risk, or not?

22-24

Major hazard at a particular point is surrounded by
area of high risk, but provides a significant short cut to
movement or to a tactically beneficial location. If you’re
willing to run the gauntlet, you can reap the rewards if
you survive intact enough to do so. Once again, tactics
is all about maximizing player decision-making

25-27

Areas in which standard abilities do not function: dead
magic, etc.

28-30

Areas in which standard abilities are weakened: ability
scores, etc.

31-33

Particular weapon required, usually an odd one. This
might be in a “death arena,” or a monster might have a
particular vulnerability, or a curse might make it impossible to use all non-clay weapons, or the characters
might have lost their normal weapons and are forced to
improvise.

34-36

Areas in which standard abilities are altered (underwater, for example)

37-39

Areas in which potential shields rise and lower (walls,
actual shields, wooden partitions, etc).

40-42

Areas which rise and sink in a predictable fashion:
being in the right place at the right time gives you the
advantage of the high ground – but not forever, because
the platform or whatever will sink back down again.

43-45

Areas in which shifting visual partitions close off line
of sight: mists and fog banks would be an example.

46-48

Situations where unusual vehicles or modes of movement must be used: hang-gliding using huge leaves, or
teleporting from disk to disk would be examples.

49-51

Situations where the effect of movement is partially
random (affected by gusting winds, tides, or small
teleportation errors, for example).
Situations where explosives can be set off (rooms with
scattered barrels of flammable oil, for example). Players love chain reactions from explosions, too.

more memorable, somehow. It’s purely psychological; but then, so is
most of adventure design.

value of the fixtures).

hallucinations, and illusions are all examples.

98-00

Situation in which a particular code of conduct must be
followed (subdue opponents only, accept surrenders, etc.).

The Movement Element:
Designing the Map
Creating a good map is one of the most important features of designing an adventure, because the map is, effectively, the game board for
all tactical movement in the game. Always return to the fundamental
question: does this map work as a game board? Because this ultimately
is the measure of a map: it is the way it will be tested, and the way in
which the players will interact with it.

Tips on Map Design

The Monstrous Element
The actual creation of monsters is covered in Book 2; as is their motivation, if you consider them to be a collective “villain” and roll on the
tables for villainous motivations in Book 1. Treated as a structural element in an adventure, however, the most important “rule” is that every
adventure should contain some combat elements. It might be tempting
from your perspective as the referee to create an “all traps” challenge,
or an adventure pitting the characters against the elements. But your
players, unless they’re an unusual group, will want some diversity in
the type of challenge their characters encounter. Single-themed adventures can get very boring very quickly, from the perspective of the
players.
Other than the fact that there should be a monstrous element, the major thing about structuring monsters into the adventure is diversity of
challenge. Vary the number and type of monsters in different encounters. An adventure in which one combat after another is against the
same type of foe, or against a single foe, is much less compelling than
one in which there are several types of monsters of varying levels of
power, some alone, some in large bands.
It is not necessary to have one “boss” monster running the show, and
it is not necessary to have a single monster act as the “climax” of an
adventure. However, it is a good idea to have one combat that’s abnormal, more difficult, or otherwise more memorable than normal. A
showcase, if you will. If you survey your finished adventure and find
that all the encounters are roughly of the same difficulty, or take place in
nondescript rooms, or that none of them involves an interesting tactical
feature, think about adding some more spice to whichever combat has
the most potential.
Here’s an odd tip – take it or leave it. As a matter of pacing the adventure, so that it has highs and lows, it’s my opinion that an adventure
should contain some completely mundane, average encounters. These
standard-issue combats have the same purpose as comedic breaks in a
horror movie: they re-set the tension level so that the next “big” thing
has more impact. As with most things involving the monstrous element,
we’re once again talking about variety and diversity. If everything is

I can’t claim credit for all these tips; I’ve received many of them from
other people:
1) A map should not be a linear pathway through the adventure. As
with all things in an adventure, the key is to provide meaningful decisions for the players to make. If your map is viewed as a flow chart,
and it has no “circular” paths allowing different ways through, then you
may want to build in more choices.
2) The map should be roughly divisible into areas with only one or
two ways into each area. This gives the players the psychological reward of getting “into a new area,” and it also means that as a game
board you have created a choke point for tactical movement. The entrances and exits to areas become significant places on the board where
enemies can be bottled up or pathways can be blocked off.
3) Try thinking of the map literally as a game board with some squares
labeled things like “go back two spaces,” or “you can buy this property,” or “advance to go, collect 200gp.” Fill your mind with all the
labels you’ve ever seen for game boards. Evaluate whether your map
would be fun to use in a game where dice are rolled for movement and
you do what it says on the various squares. Alternatively, re-envision
your map as a flow chart if that’s the way you think. Are there several
different pathways through this map?
4) Use the third dimension, with up and down movement somewhere
on the map.
5) Vary the physical features in various parts of the map. In dungeon
adventuring this means having rooms of different sizes and shape, corridors of different widths, and even areas with odd features like high
ceilings or areas where there is flooding. In wilderness adventures,
physical features can be varied with different colors of rock, different
plants or animals, different rock formations, etc.
If you keep these five tips in mind while creating a map, you should
be able to create a “flow” that maximizes the map’s tactical and adventuring qualities.

The Miscellaneous Element:
Challenges to the Character Sheet
Virtually all challenges having to do with the overall adventure should
be a challenge to the intelligence and creativity of the players at the table.
However, as with most structural elements of an adventure, change-ups are
required to vary the pace and the nature of challenges. Sometimes, success
in a challenge depends on the character sheet’s numbers: saving throws, ability scores, and the like. Otherwise, those character sheets don’t mean much.
Sometimes, traps or tricks might have a random element involved after player skill has failed. For whatever reason, the occasional test of the character
sheet gives the players a particular type of challenge: how to avoid being
tested, or how to cope when something goes wrong. Again: the primary sort
of challenge is a test of player intelligence and skill; tests of the character
sheet are the exception and the spice, not the rule or the main dish.

Table 3-5: Challenges to the Character Sheet
Die Roll

Nature of Challenge

01-25

Ability Checks: A situation requires the player to roll a d20 and score equal or lower than his character’s appropriate ability score.
NOTE: in general, intelligence checks should not be used – it is the player’s intelligence that should solve problems. Strength,
dexterity and constitution, the physical attributes of the character, are generally the best scores to use for “ability checks.” Avoid
using ability checks when a situation isn’t high tension or difficult. Tying knots in a rope to climb a wall just isn’t the sort of thing
that needs a random factor injected into it.

26-50

Flat chance: These sorts of challenges aren’t affected by the character sheet or anything else. There’s just a specific chance per
person that the effect will happen: whether the chance is 1 in 6 or a percentage is up to you as the referee. These sorts of challenges are often used when the players are deciding whether or not to risk something like walking over a rickety bridge. The random
factor is used to determine when the bridge falls. So, the flat chance die roll isn’t the test of player skill; the test of player skill is
whether or not to take that chance in the first place (and how to improve the odds with gadgetry or other innovations).

51-75

Random Selection: having the player pick a card from a set of five, play a game of blackjack or a game of craps, or choose which
hand a coin is in. Do you pick what’s behind curtain #1, curtain #2, or curtain #3? There’s no skill involved here, obviously, but
challenges like this add spice to the game. Sometimes, deciding whether or not to play the game, or which player will play, is
where the exercise in player skill comes up.

76-00

Saving Throw: Whereas ability checks are only linked to the physical characteristics of a regular person, some challenges are
challenges to the character’s experience. Ability checks don’t take the character’s level into account; saving throws do. Keep in
mind that at lower levels, a saving throw is difficult to make.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - DESIGNING A DUNGEON ADVENRTURE

Part Two: Designing a
Dungeon Adventure
MYSTERIES
AND CLUES

Introduction to Part Two
In keeping with the rest of this series, my objective is to provide creative sparks for adventure design by pressing lots of concepts and elements into the reader’s mind so that the creative subconscious can make
sudden, new combinations of them. Dungeon designing is such a vast
topic that I’ve organized these conceptual clouds into topics, so when
the designer is struggling for inspiration in a particular area he can dip
into the specific section or sections that seem to be the closest to what
he’s looking for. This mode of organization loses a bit of the lightningstrike power of joining together utterly dissociated concepts, but I think
it ultimately makes the book more usable.

A First, and Important, Distinction:
Lairs as Opposed to Megadungeons

There are basically two types of dungeon adventures: the
short ones where a mission can be accomplished and finished
within a small dungeon (which I call a “lair”), and the huge
dungeons designed for an almost infinite number of game
sessions (which I call a “megadungeon.” Most of the tables in
this book are applicable to both types of dungeon adventures;
however, if you are designing a mission-oriented lair adventure, you should keep in mind that anything in here relating to
the extent and size of the dungeon may generate an area that
is too large and too empty for a faster paced, mission-oriented
type of adventure.

The Concept of Mystery
in a Dungeon Adventure
As a starting point for the discussion of dungeon design, it might seem
strange to begin with the concept of mysteries and how to evolve what
the players know about the dungeon. But an adventure doesn’t just develop in terms of area explored or monsters killed; it also develops in
terms of the players gaining more and more information about the situation and the location. Sometimes this knowledge has no practical application in game terms, but make no mistake – it is intensely satisfying
to the players if they gain more understanding about things. Even the
best-designed adventure in the world will fail on a critical level if the
players finish the adventure with no sense of ever having understood
what the hell was going on. Even in a megadungeon type of adventure,
it is highly rewarding to the players if they get scraps of information
about who lived in the place, what their names were, what happened
to them, and why the megadungeon eventually became the province of
deadly monsters instead of the original creators and delvers.

Underlying Truth:
The Backstory
A backstory is the history of events that have taken place, both significant and trivial. Backstories are necessary in order to generate clues
and rumors about the dungeon, because you’ll need something for these
clues and rumors to be about. For many designers, knowing the backstory of an area is also a strong spur to creativity.
There are several approaches to creating a backstory, and the tables
in this section are all alternatives for each other – it doesn’t work to
combine the results from more than one table in this particular section.

Examples of Item-based Backstories

Using Table 3-7, one might get a result of: “A statue or
idol was introduced in order to cause a problem, with the
additional factor of family identity.” The question is how to
dream that into the history of a dungeon (or any other sort
of adventure you might be planning). The easiest assumption, since we’ve got the tried-and-true dungeon standby of
the statue, is that the thing was introduced into the
dungeon. Clearly, someone provided the statue in order to
cause problems, and the only matter to resolve is what sort
of problem a statue might cause for family identity. There are
various possibilities that can be generated solely from that one
entry:
The title to ownership of a castle (with the dungeons underneath) was contested between two members of a family, the Azon branch and the Zeon branch. According
to the Azon branch, Argos Azon was born before Zaun
Zeon, but an ancient statue in the dungeons shows an older
Zaun standing next to a younger Zeon. As minor elements,
you might introduce evidence of the battle into the dungeon, and a few scraps of paper about which son was older.
As a more major element, you might decide that the benevolent and kindly Azon family was displaced by the evil and
sinister Zeons, with effaced murals of the Azons, broken statues, etc.
On the other hand, the same backstory elements could be

used to build a dungeon history in which an individual is trying to claim that he is a member of a powerful family. The
family cannot allow this because the person is a pirate, or a
murderer. Since there is an old statue of some family member
who looks almost exactly like the roguish newcomer, the family arranges to have the statue hidden away in the depths of
a dungeon beneath their castle. Since the outsider is a pirate,
perhaps he launches a recovery mission – and if he’s a pirate,
he should do it by boat, right? That immediately gives you
the idea of a river running through the dungeon map. So in
this case, the backstory can directly give you an idea not just
about the dungeon’s history, but some inspiration about the
map itself!
A third possibility, just to illustrate how flexible this table
can be, is to look at these results from a completely different direction than the examples above. Perhaps the priesthood
in a deep subterranean community (possibly not even human)
is hereditary, and another family challenges this ancient
tradition. An idol in the dungeon gives out oracles and
signs, and there is some sort of convocation called in which
the idol is called upon to resolve the question. Here you’ve
got an idea about what the mysterious statue does, possibly some sort of theological dispute, definitely the idea that
religious powers might be involved, and all sorts of other
possibilities…

Clues
Clues are bits and pieces of incomplete information that the players
(characters) perceive directly and must interpret. It is best to make their
solutions fairly obvious; it’s much more difficult to figure things out
from the player side than one might think, especially when you aren’t
paving the way for them with things like “an intelligence check.” And
don’t do that! Die rolls used to substitute for players thinking and deduction will rob the players of the feeling of joy and accomplishment
when they figure something out.
But on the other hand, if the clues are too difficult, you also rob the
players of the same feeling of accomplishment – it’s fine to provide
some hard clues that conceal really useful information, but most clues
should be quite simple. It’s also obvious, I think, that the difficulty
of the clue should correspond to the usefulness of the information it
reveals.

Evidence of Mechanism or Use
Table 3-14: Evidence of Mechanism or Use
Die Roll

Type of Evidence (d100)

01-10

Cleaned room: evidences recent use, presence of oozes, or removal of evidence

11-20

Presence of tools: indicates recent use and possibly presence of something the tools are intended to be used on (this thing might be
hidden).

21-30

Scratches on walls or floor: can evidence presence of the moving parts of a trap, presence of a secret door, or something that has
been dragged from one place to another

31-40

Holes in walls or floor: these might be marks from impact (possibly from a trap or portcullis), might be vents for the functioning
of a trap, might function as a keyhole or contain buttons, and might be the lair of some small monster

41-50

Pockmarks or corrosion on wall or floor: can indicate monsters that use acid, or the presence of a gas trap.

51-60

Aquatic tools: this includes fishing nets, boats, broken boats, fishhooks, buoys, or diving equipment. Indicates presence of water
nearby.

61-70

Recent painting or carving: some sort of decoration has been added. This obviously indicates recent use of the area, and probably
an intention to stay. A corollary question is why this particular sort of decoration was chosen and whether it indicates the type of
creature that chose it. Keep in mind that paint might be covering or concealing something, and statues can also be used to conceal
doors, trapdoors, and holes in the floor. They can be faucets for gas, or counterweights.

71-80

Warning signs: these might be painted “Keep out” signs, or might be as primitive as a skull on a post. They indicate borders and
boundaries, and may disclose the nature of the creatures that put up the sign. They might also indicate clues about who is being
warned away.

81-90

Operating machinery: whether the machine is a water channel or a piece of incomprehensible complexity, if it’s operating then
someone turned it on and maintains it.

91-00

Furnishings and carpets: if an ancient area has new carpeting, someone is nearby. Carpets can conceal other clues, and chairs can
be trapped. Beware.

Part of Decorations
Sometimes, information can be gained by looking at a portrait (“hey, isn’t that a map she’s holding?”), a statue (“that sword in his hand looks
like the one we found earlier”), and even furniture (“that is a really, really, big chair”). Putting clues into decorations just doesn’t really translate
into a random generation table, unfortunately.

Remnants of an Event
Table 3-15: Type of Event Leaving the Clue
Die Roll

Type of Event (d100)

01-10

Agreement or treaty: the obvious evidence of a treaty or agreement is the document itself, if it was the sort of agreement one writes
down. Other written evidence can be a letter in which the agreement is mentioned or is obvious.

11-20

Battle: battles and combats are usually evidenced by the presence of broken arrows, possibly bloodstains, and in some cases the
evidence of spell casting.

21-30

Betrayal: visual evidence of a betrayal is a bit hard to manage, unless a mirror or some other magical device recorded the event for
posterity. A letter is one way of accomplishing this kind of clue, or (depending on the adventure) the clue might be something like
an opened entryway that was supposed to keep enemies out.

31-40

Cave-in: either the area is completely blocked, or it has been cleaned out and a lot of rock is missing. Note that wooden structures
can also collapse. Why did the area cave in, what might it hide, and who is responsible? Does it indicate that the ceiling above
the party’s heads is unstable; does it indicate that the enemies around the corner have rigged explosives, or does it mean that earth
elementals are rampaging in the area? Add some details, and you have a good clue.

41-50

Execution: there’s a dead body, or a stake with scorch marks around it, or a skeleton hanging from a noose, or some other sign that
an execution took place. Why did it happen? That’s not necessarily part of this clue, but if it’s just a random piece of “dungeon
dressing,” then you’ve missed a good chance to convey information to the players for future use (or further knowledge about the
location and events there).

51-60

Fire: why was there a fire? An execution, arson, evidence of a fire-using monster? Does it reveal the location of a trap, does it
show that combustibles were stored here, or does it reveal something else?

61-70

Flooding: an area is full of water, or there are signs that it once was. This could include a waterline stain, seashells in a dry area,
fish bones, or other such evidence. Why was the area underwater? To kill people? To store water for drinking, experiments, or
fire fighting? Perhaps there is a secret door at the waterline used for access to the sea or an underground lake. Possibly an aquatic
monster once lived here. Possibly the ceiling is about to open and flood the chamber while the adventurers are looking around.

Type of Event (d100)

71-80

Functioning of a trap: this is also covered in evidence of mechanism or use. Here, instead of the sort of markings left by a mechanical device, we’re probably talking dead bodies.

81-90

Imprisonment: evidence of imprisonment could include a skeleton chained to a wall or in a cell; it could include written records of
a jailer, and it could include scratches left on the wall by a prisoner. These are just a few of the more obvious examples.

91-00

Lovers’ tryst: evidence of a lover’s tryst might be quite blatant; such as a love letter, or a rumpled and recently vacated bed; or it
might be relatively subtle, with clues such as a coded love letter, or the smell of a distinctive perfume somewhere it isn’t supposed
to be. The identities of the lovers might not be apparent until this clue is connected with another clue.

Written Information
Written clues, warnings, and rumors aren’t necessarily always found
on a conveniently dropped piece of parchment. Take a look at the section on written tricks for some ideas about unusual writing surfaces and
writing methods.

Journal, Diary, or Written Account
The nature of a written clue often determines the sort of information
content it might provide. Or, vice versa if you’re starting with a piece
of information you want to convey to the players. If the writing is some
sort of correspondence, Table 3-7 (Coded and Deliberate Messages)
can be used to generate some details. If, on the other hand, the writing is purely for the writer’s use (recipes or notes to self, for example)
you’ll have to get a bit creative about what it might reveal. An alchemist’s notes to self will be very different from a sergeant’s or a jailer’s.
Recipes can reveal a lot, since they may mention supply sources or
contain instructions for where to get ingredients.

Generating Magical Symbols
From time to time, you may need to draw the picture of a rune or glyph that’s found on a dungeon door or stitched into a mysterious tapestry.
This table allows you to create mystic sigils; roll once on each column, starting with the basic shape of the rune in column 1 and modifying it as
described in columns 2 and 3.

Attach a small circle to the top, bottom,
or side of the figure

41-50

Letter of the Alphabet (capital) (1d6): A, B, C,
D, E, or F.

Put a second Basic Form next to it,
touching

Place a small circle next to, on top of,
or below the figure, not touching

51-60

Letter of the Alphabet (capital) (1d6) G, H, I,
J, K, L.

Put identical figure below it, touching,
upside down

Duplicate the figure, upside down,
directly below or next to the existing
figure.

61-70

Letter of the Alphabet (capital) (1d6) M, N, O,
Put identical figure next to it, touching
P, Q, R.

Start from one of the figure’s points or
ends, and draw a spiraling line starting
from that point

71-80

Letter of the Alphabet (capital) (1d6) S, T, U,
V, W, X.

Put a wavy horizontal line beneath the
figure or a wavy vertical line to its left
or right

81-90

Complex shape (1d6): (1) Star 5 point, (2)
star, 6 point, (3) crescent, (4) circle with cross
superimposed, lines of cross extending beTurn on side, counterclockwise
yond edges of circle, (5) diamond with cross
superimposed, lines of cross extending beyond
diamond’s edge, (6) hourglass shape

91-00

Simple picture (1d8): Sun, crescent moon,
tree, flower, tower, human stick figure, or leaf.

Turn on side, clockwise

Turn upside down, or, if this results in
no change, connect two random points
in the basic form with a curved line

Keep in mind that the capital letters of the alphabet referred to in
this table are meant to identify a set of basic line shapes, not letters.
If they resemble letters too much, your rune is going to look too
modern and the elements of it will be too obvious. These are basic
starter-shapes, not letters.
There are some tricks to help you overcome this difficulty. The
first trick is to alter the “normal” line lengths involved in drawing
a capital letter of the alphabet – i.e., the proportions of the letter.
The second trick is to draw the capital letter partly using straight
lines and partly using curved lines. The third trick is to vary line
widths in the rune, making some lines thicker than others. This
third trick generates more artistic and magical-looking runes, but
can generate crappy-looking results until you get the hang of it.
Stretch normal dimensions and add curlicues if your rune is still
looking too recognizable.

No further modification

One experiment for varying line widths can be done by going to an
art supply store or a craft store and getting hold of an artist’s “crow
quill” pen. A crow quill is a pen you dip in ink, with a very narrow nib.
When you are drawing a normal line, the line is extremely thin; but by
adding slightly more pressure the line will widen. An experienced artist
would use a larger nib pen or a brush for this, just to get a bigger final
picture, but a crow quill is easier for a beginner because the small nib
makes it easier to control ink flow. The more ink your tool can deliver
to the paper, the cooler you can make your results, but it also makes it
much easier to screw up. I definitely recommend starting with a crow
quill – and they also have the advantage of being cheap.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - DESIGNING A DUNGEON ADVENTURE

Codes and Ciphers
Codes and ciphers can be a great tool in an adventure, but if they are too
difficult they can cause a big problem, too. In general, remember that what
looks easy to the referee is probably a lot harder for the players to figure out.
Keep codes very, very simple if the players are actually supposed to decode
them, and provide the key somewhere in case the players can’t figure it out,
or lose patience.
Four different types of codes/ciphers are described below. Each method
can be used to generate a variety of actual codes.
1) Shuffle the letters of the alphabet forward or backward by a specific
number (this is called the “Julius Caesar Cipher”). Example: if the shufflenumber is 2, then the letter “A” would be written as “C,” which is 2 letters
forward in the alphabet. The letter “C” would be written as “E,” and so forth.
If the writer wanted to write AC in this cipher, he would write CE.
2) A more complex form of cipher is to assign a number to each letter of the
alphabet. The simplest version of this cipher would be to assign the numbers
as A=1, B=2, C=3, etc. “ABC” in this code would be written as “123.” A
stronger code might have a key to show the letter-to-number relation. “A”

might be assigned arbitrarily to the number “5,” “B” might be assigned to the
number “1,” and the rest of the letters would also be given numbers to represent them. From the standpoint of writing an adventure, this sort of cipher
would be really annoying to the players because it’s simply too hard or too
time-consuming to break without the key. If you don’t have the key easily
available somewhere for the players to find, avoid ciphers that will take too
much time to break.
3) Letters can be substituted for other letters according to a key; these codes
are extremely difficult to break without having a copy of the key.
4) A message can be embodied in an innocuous communication using a
formula like this one: “every tenth word is a word of the real message. Ignore
all other words.” A more complicated formula would not use the same interval. Such a key might read as follows: “the words of the message are words
number 10, 15, 30, 41, 50.” In this case, the key would probably be necessary
for players to be able to break the code – although it might be workable if (a)
the players enjoy puzzles like codebreaking and (b) they know from somewhere that the nature of the code is to use words at intervals.

Alternate Alphabets as Easy Codes
An additional form of code is simply to use a different alphabet for
normal writing, requiring the players only to figure out the transliteration. This approach adds mystery into the dungeon, but is relatively
easy for the players to figure out if you label several innocuous rooms
with the alphabet before presenting the players with an important piece

of information. Some usable alphabets are shown below. Note that the
second column is (pretty much) the Greek alphabet, and can be transliterated by anyone knowing that alphabet; Tolkien fans or scholars of
Norse might also be able to transliterate the Futhark-based runes of the
first column.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - DESIGNING A DUNGEON ADVENTURE
There are a vast number of fantasy fonts available on the Internet
that can serve as a code alphabet. The Autorealm Phoenician font used
in the above table is one of these, taken from the Autorealm mapping
site. Hieroglyph fonts, Hebrew, and pictograms are also good if you
don’t want to provide any clues by using letters with similarities to their
modern equivalents. Script fonts that connect letters are much harder
to decipher, since the players won’t know where one letter ends and
another begins, so I don’t recommend these.
Many player will be aware that “e” is the most commonly used letter
in the English language, since this knowledge was well disseminated
in the Sherlock Holmes story, “The Dancing Men.” Making the letter
“e” recognizable will go a long way toward making an alphabet code
easier to decipher.

Generating Riddles
Just as with codes and ciphers, remember that what looks easy from
behind the referee’s screen is actually a lot harder for the players to figure out. It is good planning to have the solution available somewhere
else in the adventure, and NEVER make solving a riddle the only way
for the players to proceed all the way through an adventure.
The easiest way to create a riddle is to follow the steps below:
Start with the answer you want, such as, “horse.”
Jot down the distinctive characteristics of the thing you’ve chosen as
the riddle’s answer. A horse, for example, has four legs, a mane, a tail,
carries a rider, has hoofs, etc. This is a brainstorming step; write down
everything you can think of.
Consider ways of describing these characteristics in a vague or poetic
manner. For example, a horse is a land-strider. Because a person sits on
it, it can be “man’s throne.” And its iron-shod feet make sparks when
they strike stone. Thus, “Land strider, man’s throne, sparks fly when I
step to stone.”
Take a shot at putting a rhyme or two into the riddle. It’s not necessary, but the impact is far better.
If the site is still on the Internet, it’s worth mentioning that the best
description of how to write archaic riddles can be found at http://catb.
org/esr/riddle-poems.html.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - THE MAP

The Map
Introduction
The various sections of this part of the book are organized in the context of a random dungeon generator, but they are actually intended to
be used separately, when you are looking for a bit of specific inspiration
about some feature in a dungeon you aren’t generating randomly. The
other possible way of organizing them was alphabetically, and I decided
that as a creative tool, it would be better to provide some connection
between the elements instead of presenting them in isolation. Even if
the designer is initially looking for an isolated element, the connections
themselves might serve as an independent source of inspiration.

words, the dungeon map is “granular,” made up of distinct pieces. There
are several reasons for constructing a dungeon map in this fashion: the
small number of connections makes each one tactically important for
escape route and ambushes, and because the areas are segmented, the
players themselves gain a sense of excitement when they realize they
have discovered a new area of the dungeon. The dungeon level has
regions, rather than being a single, undifferentiated whole.
Perhaps as importantly, dividing the dungeon map into such segments
allows you, as the designer, to apply your different creative inspirations
in small bites. It is much easier to work several different ideas into a
dungeon level when there are naturally existing borders to separate one
idea from the next.

Dungeon Areas

Quick Inspiration
If what you’re looking for is just a quick inspiration for “what comes
next” in an existing dungeon, it’s a bit irritating to be faced with an
entire dungeon-generation system. There are a couple of quick ways to
get ideas for “what comes next.”
Starting wherever you need some inspiration (the edge of your existing map), and go directly to Table 3-23 to generate ideas for the transition into a new area. Once that’s done, go to Table 3-37 to see what’s
on the other side of the transition area. Table 3-37 generates the general
layout of a set of rooms and chambers, and can be used to generate the
shape and sizes of those areas.
Another possibility is to jump all the way down to Tables 3-78 and
3-79 and see which one of them you like best (these two tables are
similar but alternate methods). Table 3-78 offers general ideas for what
might come next in a dungeon, without many references to the tables.
Table 3-79, on the other hand, is designed to direct you back into the
tables – it is like a master table for jumping randomly into the tables. In
other words, Table 3-78 is for use if you’re feeling pretty creative, and
Table 3-79 is for use if you want to treat this whole section as a grabbag of tables instead of a step-by-step process.
The third alternative is just to browse through the tables until something catches your eye as an interesting idea.

Arranging the Areas
The first step in designing a dungeon holistically is to create the arrangement of the areas (groups of rooms) and their connections.
The dungeon is divided into areas, and each area is connected to others by a “transition.” Roll for the arrangement of the areas on the chart
below. The lines are the transition areas, the square box is the starting
area, and the circles are areas found beyond the starting area. It is a
good idea to sketch the resulting diagram (or one you create) onto a full
sized sheet of paper, because you will probably be writing notes about
each circle and line before you move on to creating a real map.

Holistic Dungeon
Generation
Every method I have seen for generating random dungeon maps is
a linear “walk” through the dungeon’s passageways, with the dice
generating whatever comes next beyond the last element you generated. This sort of method isn’t completely horrible if you’re pressed
for time, and it can certainly provide you with flashes of inspiration.
There is, however, a somewhat better way of creating a dungeon map,
in which the designer has a bit more influence over the process as it
develops. At the very least, this means you won’t have to erase big
parts of the map as often as you do when using a linear generator. At
its best, it allows you as the dungeon designer to integrate your own
creative processes more easily into the overall pattern of random results as that pattern develops.

Transitions Between Dungeon Areas
(The Connecting Lines)
Each line on the dungeon’s chart of areas is a “transition,” that can be
as simple as a door or as bizarre as a teleportation device. Roll for each
transition line on your chart, determine if there is a trick associated with
it, and note that all down next to the line.

The Concept of Dungeon Areas

A dungeon “area” is a set of rooms (or chambers, or caverns) that are
separated from other groups by only one or two connections. In other

4

River blocks corridor or room, but there is a ford or causeway

5

Lake must be crossed. Boats might or might not be available.

6

Waterfall must be crossed, ridden down, or broken through to reach connected area

7

A tunnel or corridor is approximately waist-deep in water or other liquid

Defining and Developing Dungeon Areas
This section of the book is about building and detailing small pieces
of the dungeon map – whether or not you’re using the “Holistic Dungeon Generator.” If you are using the Generator as a tool, then defining
and developing the areas of the dungeon is the next step after generating the transitions between them.

Area Details
Roll for the number of rooms, then use the indicated formula for
Rooms of Unusual Size. For this table, “Rooms” includes caves and
cavern chambers if the topography of the area is natural caverns.

Area Topography

Table 3-38: Rooms or Chambers in a Dungeon Area

Without getting into over-specific categories like the difference between lava tubes and limestone river-caverns, there are only three basic
types of dungeon topography. Roll for each area, or just decide what’s
appropriate to the area.

Arrangement of Rooms/Caverns Within the Area
Arranging the elements of a dungeon area is the most difficult part of the process. Roll on the table below to determine the abstract description
of how the rooms are arranged. This table doesn’t specify the length of any interior corridors or which things are directly connected, so all these
arrangements can yield very different results (see the diagrams that follow the table).

Table 3-41: Arrangement of Rooms/Caverns Within an Area
Die Roll

Arrangement (d100)

01-10

A central room has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are part of the suites. Each suite is a
self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the others, but most rooms will be connected to more than one other room).

11-20

A main corridor branches into two (either as a Y or a T shaped junction). The rest of the rooms in the area are in suites entering into
one of the corridor’s branches. Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the others, but most rooms will be connected to more than one other room).

21-30

A single connecting corridor has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are part of the suites. Each
suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms (each room is not, of course, connected to all the others, but most rooms
will be connected to more than one other room).

158

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - THE MAP
Table 3-41: Arrangement of Rooms/Caverns Within an Area - Continued
Die Roll

Arrangement (d100)

31-40

All rooms enter onto a single, central corridor that makes one or more turns along its length

41-50

All rooms enter onto a single, straight, central corridor

51-60

All rooms enter onto one central room (probably a room of unusual size, if one is present)

61-70

All rooms enter onto the corridors of a central T-junction or four-way intersection.

71-80

Connecting corridor forms a square, circle, or rectangle (i.e., it surrounds an internal area). About half the rooms are enclosed by
the corridor, and the other half enter onto the outside wall of the corridor.

81-90

Connecting corridor forms a square, circle, or rectangle (i.e., it surrounds an internal area). All rooms are inside the enclosed area.
Rooms may interconnect directly with each other, or might not. The internal area need not be completely filled by the rooms, and
the surrounding corridor might make turns along its path before closing the “circle.”

91-00

Two central rooms are connected to each other by a corridor; all other rooms enter onto one or the other of the central rooms

Sample Diagrams of Identical Table Results
Each arrangement of rooms described in Table 3-41 affords tremendous flexibility; the table merely suggests the relative relation of the
rooms, without much more detail.
4 examples of areas with the same result: 2d6 rooms (and then a roll of 8 for the number of rooms), having 2 rooms of unusual size, with
a roll of 21 for Arrangement: “A single connecting corridor has one or more “suites” entering into it; the rest of the rooms in the area are
part of the suites. Each suite is a self-contained group of interconnected rooms”

Placing Landmarks
Each level in a large dungeon should have landmarks in it. Just as with
the fractal-type arrangement of the map into areas and transitions between them, landmarks continue to nail down the map’s geography:
without landmarks, the dungeon map risks being perceived by the players
as an undifferentiated whole, where exploration is a boring process with
no meaningful discoveries to be made. Landmarks in general include:

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - THE MAP

Level Changes (Landmarks)
Don’t create dungeon levels like a computer game, where there’s one
way down to the next level and virtually the entire level needs to be explored to get there. If you’re using the “holistic Dungeon” method, put
in about one level change per two “areas.” Also keep in mind that not
all level changes need to be stairs. Some of them can be the equivalent
of traps, taking the adventurers completely unawares!

Unusual Aspect of Stairs (d100)

01-10

Stairwell changes position to lead to different locations
(either depth or different locations on a particular level)
based on pattern of steps taken by first person descending/ascending the stairs. Example: normal step-step-step
leads to location 1, but two steps down and one step
back causes the stairs to lead to an entirely different
location.

11-20

Stairs sometimes lead up, and sometimes lead down –
not always perceptible in some cases (unless a dwarf is
in the party to notice)

*If the level change is to be concealed, roll up the details as if it were
an Architectural Trick

21-30

Stairs lead nowhere without particular command word
or item

Stairs

31-40

Stairs lead over lava, water, or other hazard

41-50

Stairs are squishy, spongy, or sticky

51-60

Stairs are suspended from cables or ropes rather than being fastened into wall with beams (i.e., normal stairs)

61-70

Stairwell contains some stairs leading up, and some
down, not a continuous direction all the way to destination.

71-80

Stair steps are invisible, making the stairwell resemble
a chute

81-90

Stairs are corrosive, hot, or freezing, causing slow and
progressive damage unless proper precautions are taken

91-00

Stairs tilt, tremble, and shift, making it difficult to maintain footing

or 3-85) or Magic Thing Tricks (see Table 3-96 and following), and can
also be trapped (see Tables 3-126 and following).

Table 3-55: Altars
Die Roll

Special Rooms
Special Rooms are simply the rooms with more detail to them than
just monsters, treasure, and/or bits of dungeon dressing. They don’t
have to be super-dramatic (that’s more the role of Big Things and
Strange Things), but they should generally be interactive or provide
information, one or the other. In some cases they might incorporate
tricks or traps, but beware – you don’t want to make every interesting
room contain something dangerous, or the players will eventually assume that every room containing more detail than a broken arrow on
the floor is a risk. Leave many of these rooms to be nothing more than
… interesting.

(probably temporarily)

Is a spy, infiltrator,
monster, shapeshifter, or other
type of being that
will eventually

to the party. It will
likely convey a
primary benefit,
but treachery will
be down the road.

Response –
whatever it might
be – is affected
by an enchantment, drugs, or
illusions.

None. Might even
be annoying or
cause problematic
effects elsewhere
in the dungeon.

Is enchanted as
51-60 another sort of
being

Response depends
entirely on whether
the party has
picked up some
item, knows a pass- Reward for Rescue, or Bounty for
word, is wearing
particular garments, Capture
or has a particular
appearance (this is
likely a guard of
some kind).

Thrones
The Thrones table can be used to generate increasingly complex ideas for a throne, depending on whether you roll on one, two, or all three columns. Roll on column one to generate a bit of inspiration for a throne that doesn’t do anything in particular. Roll on columns one and two (or one
and three) for a throne with more history or power, and roll on all three columns if you need ideas for a throne with a great deal of history or power.

useful content of Written Records can also be generated on Table 3-17.

Water Landmarks
Some water landmarks may already have been generated as a transition between areas (if you’re going through these tables step by step).
If this is the case, don’t feel obligated to put in more water landmarks,
but if you’ve got waterway transitions, you certainly have the potential
to create a dungeon level that involves quite a bit of water. Which is
always cool.

The “What Comes
Next” Method
Sometimes you just want some creative ideas for what comes next
in a dungeon you’re already designing, and you don’t want to get deep
into a whole system for designing a dungeon from the top down. The
following table is easier to use when the problem is just a bit of creative
block happening mid-stride. It points you back to the above tables, but
gives you a specific place to start instead of just paging around for an
idea.

Tricks
The “Trick” is a very broad concept in adventure design, and I’m
not going to try to define it exactly. In general, a trick is something
that requires the players to make meaningful decisions but that
isn’t a monster or a trap. Tricks can range all the way from a sliding corridor to a riddle written on a scrap of parchment.
There are about an infinite number of ways to try and break down the
broad concept of a dungeon trick into a series of tables. After literally
years of screwing around with it, I’ve decided to compile my tables into
eleven categories: Architectural Tricks, Bargain and Persuasion Tricks,
Experiment Tricks, False Appearance Tricks, Hazard Tricks, Magic
Area Tricks, Magic Thing Tricks, Run-the-Gauntlet Tricks, Substance
Tricks, Wager and Game Tricks, and Written Tricks. There is a great
deal of crossover between these categories, too, so don’t approach these
tables as if each category is a formula.
This section is organized as follows:

Hints and Foreshadowings. These tables can be used for all the categories, so they come first.
The Separate Categories (each with sub-tables):
Architectural Tricks
Bargain and Persuasion Tricks
Experiment Tricks
False Appearance Tricks
Hazard Tricks
Magic Area Tricks
Magic Thing Tricks
Run-the-Gauntlet Tricks
Substance Tricks
Wager and Game Tricks.
Written Tricks
General Subtables. Certain categories make reference to the same
sub-tables, so these are gathered together at the end of the section.

The Wild Card Matrix. An alternative, short-form table used to generate the broad, overall profile of a trick, ignoring everything else in
this section.

Method 1: The Wild Card Matrix
This table is not for the faint of heart – it’s used to generate the overall profile of a trick with absolutely no rhyme or reason, instead of picking
a category and working from there. Roll for each component of the trick (hints, structure, rewards, risks, and solutions), then put them together in
any way that your inspiration takes you.

1

An actual living being is
present. Somehow. This
includes everything from
a talking animal, to a
person, to a demon.

It either died here or is
trapped here, and if the
characters solve the trick
it will be released

It only gives one clue, and then
taunts. The taunts may be helpful,
since they only come when the characters are doing something wrong (or
when they are indecisive)

Speaks once,
before the trick
starts, delivering a
rhymed couplet, a
limerick, or a haiku

Polite and humble
(even taunting
can be delivered
like this)

It is a construction or
remnant of something
that really hates (or
hated) the person who
constructed the trick.

Progressive hints. The voice offers
an ongoing commentary to give the
players a status report. For example,
it might say, “Cold,” “warm,” or
“hot” as characters get closer to (or
farther from) the solution. If the players are negotiating with a personality,
the personality might get very pissed
off at the talking clue. The personality and the talking clue might be
long-time enemies, two facets of a
being with multiple personalities, etc.

Makes itself
known to the party,
answers one question, and then falls
silent or disappears.

Egotistical and
Superior

Speaks once,
during the trick
itself, delivering a
rhymed couplet, a
limerick, or a haiku. Basically, it’s
a pre-programmed
hint if the characters are pursuing a
predictable course
of failure, if they
are inactive, or if
they need to know
that they have now
succeeded.

Sinister and
hostile

2

3

Carved image or statue
of a living being (animal, human, or monster)

Disembodied voice or
mental communications

Makes itself known to the party
It is a reminder to the
before the trick, and then answers
builder’s friends or allies
limited questions about what they
about how to get the
will be facing. It does not help once
benefit.
the trick begins.

It was simply designed
as a built-in part of the
challenge

Makes compliments as the players
are making progress, such as, “Well
done.”

Makes a victory
or defeat speech
at the end of the
Eerie or spooky
trick, depending on
whether the party
succeeded.

5

Ghostly image of animal, human, or monster
either talks or sends
mental messages

It either died here or is
trapped here, and if the
characters solve the trick
it will be released

Speaks riddles, poetry or vague
instructions each time the players
complete some part of the trick,
basically introducing them to the next
part. Alternatively, it says something
at the end of each part to let the
players know something has been
completed.A threat, challenge, and/or
taunting before the trick begins.

General taunting.
This will certainly indicate that
something is about
to happen, or that
Jovial
there is a challenge
available, although
it might not convey
anything else
except attitude.

6

Part of the trick itself
communicates (example:
you’ve got to figure out
how to get a fireplace to
rise away from a passageway – the fireplace itself
starts talking or sending
mental messages)

It was simply designed
as a built-in part of the
challenge

Makes itself known to the party, and
then answers limited questions while
they are trying to solve the trick.

This might include
a game of twenty
questions, or it
might only have
a limited set of
answers.

4

Energy shape talks or
sends mental messages

Either nervous or angry, depending on whether it likes or dislikes the adventurers

Experiment Tricks
In general, an experiment trick is just the combination of things by the characters, and the results. Sometimes these tricks are obvious (three bottles and
mixing basin, or three levers), and sometimes they are not obvious (they combine themselves). It’s best to decide that after generating the trick, though.
To generate an experiment trick, roll on the Master Table to see what

two types of elements are being combined, and what the general type
of result is going to be. Roll for specific results on the appropriate columns of the Table of First Elements and the Table of Second Elements.
Then juggle those elements around with the “Result Type” and see what
emerges (the Result Types are explained after the tables).

Table 3-87: Master Table of Experiment Tricks
Note: If your experiment turns out to look like something that might have both a good result and a bad result, roll a second time on the Result Type
column to get the alternate possibility. Sometimes, once you’ve generated the experiment and gotten one result, the other possibility will be very clear.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - TRICKS
Categories of Different Results (Explanations)
Transmutation: Something or someone is, or can be, changed as a result of the experiment.
Processing: Something is developed or manipulated, and this changes something else. Much like a transmutation, but it is indirect. For example,
a character might get processed into fuel for something else. Or, the charcoal you feed into the statue’s mouth might be turned into the key for a
door. This is a two-step process rather than a one-step process.
Movements or Access: Successfully conducting the experiment opens a door, allows you to get through something, or gives you something you
can use to get through something.
Conditions and Curses: Instead of actually being changed, your condition changes. For example, you might get blessed, cursed, diseased,
cured, healed, electrically charged, able to fly, or crushed. There are many possibilities.
Generation or Genesis: The combination of the trick’s two elements creates something. This might be a useful or harmful substance, it might
be a dimensional gateway, it might be a key or other useful item.

Magic Area Tricks
Area tricks are those in which an “area” plays a role; the trick affects
an area when it “activates,” or else it’s triggered by entering the area
(possibly with the additional requirement of taking an action).
The trick’s actions are described in terms of a combination of four
possible elements:
Correct Action
Wrong Action
Beneficial Magical Condition (see Table 3-118)
Curse (see Table 3-118)
Many area tricks have the area marked off in some way, so they are
puzzles rather than just a series of surprises. This is largely up to you,
although tables are included to give you ideas for marking areas.

Table 3-93: Magic Area Tricks Master Table
Die

Combination of the Four Elements of an Area Trick
(d100)

Confers a “curse” effect if the players take a wrong action,
and a “beneficial magical condition” if the players take a
correct action. (see Table 3-118 for conditions and curses)

26-50

Confers a beneficial magical condition if players take the
correct action, does nothing otherwise. (see Table 3-118
for conditions and curses)

51-75

Immediately confers a “curse” effect, but a correct action
will remove the effect. (see Table 3-118 for conditions and
curses)

76-00

Randomly confers beneficial magical conditions or curses
each time the correct action is taken (probably with a cutoff of some kind on the number of times it can be used).

Magic Thing Tricks
Interacting with magical things is one of the staples of a dungeon adventure, and it is a broad topic, since neither the word “magic” nor the
word “thing” does much to narrow down the category.
Magic Thing tricks are composed of four basic elements:
A Warning (possibly): Table 3-96
A Central Feature: Table 3-97
A Triggering Action: 3-99
Result of Triggering the Trick: Table 3-100

Table 3-96: Warnings
Die Roll

Warnings (d100)

01-50

None. This sort of trick hits the party by surprise. Sometimes a surprise-trick just means they have to think fast,
but often surprise-tricks are the more dangerous type – in
which the party has to cope with magical results that
have already taken effect on them.

51-53

Antigravity or levitation effect in surrounding area, possibly objects are floating in air (as opposed to the central
feature itself)

54-56

Central feature emits heat, cold, or some sort of electricity or lightning (including a static charge)

57-59

Central feature floats in the air

60-62

Central feature is difficult to approach; it might be protected by a force field, be at the top of a long, winding
ramp, or be on an island in a pool of acid, as examples.

63-65

Central feature is in some way decorated far more than
one would expect. This might range from as little as a
coat of paint, all the way up to something just dripping
with jewels.

66-68

Central feature moves in unexpected ways. Any movement at all would be unusual in an inanimate object;
living objects might flicker in and out of existence,
teleport from place to place, or just move in ways other
than “normal.”

The central feature has some anthropomorphic feature

features.

Emits Warning Signal and then provides a benefit of
some kind. However, if the party doesn’t then provide
a Correct Response (Table 3-102), the benefit will be
taken away again, reverse itself into a curse, or otherwise elicit a bad response.

61-65

Cyclical Activation: the trick activates at particular
times. This might be a time of day, it might be after
certain “recharging” intervals, or it might be at longer
intervals such as the changing of the seasons or the anniversary of an event

Presence of a particular character race

Presence of light, darkness, or other specific change in
the environmental conditions around the trick

Emits Warning Signal and then waits for a Correct Response (Table 3-102). It probably gives a clue of some
sort about what that action is, either by speaking, mental
communication, revealing something written, making a
gesture, etc. If the Correct Response is not taken (within
some period of time), the Thing confers a curse, mental
disability, a physical disability, or steals stuff (see Table
3-118 and following tables for ideas). If the Correct
Response is made, the thing confers a beneficial magical
condition (see Table 3-118 for this, also).

81-85

Proximity (delayed): the trick activates at a predetermined interval after someone comes near

86-90

Proximity (immediate): the trick “activates” whenever
someone is nearby, with no other action being necessary

51-60

91-95

Specific action: the trick activates if a character undertakes a specific action such as trying to open a door or
drawing a weapon

Emits Warning Signal, and waits a moment. Everyone
standing in the right place (however that is determined)
gets a beneficial magical condition (Table 3-118). Everyone standing in the wrong place gets a curse (Table
3-118). In some cases, there might also be neutral areas
where the trick does nothing.

96-00

Spell cast nearby (possibly any spell, possibly a specific
spell)

61-70

The Thing asks a question and waits for the right
answer. Giving the right answer gets you a beneficial
magical condition (3-118). Giving the wrong answer
gets you a curse (3-118). In some cases, you might be
allowed more than one wrong answer before getting
hit for it. If more than one wrong answer is permitted,
There might be some indication of how many more are
left. This might be, for example, a rising water level,
a statue holding up one finger to indicate the wrong
answer, a statue putting down one of three fingers to
indicate that one of the three wrong answers has been
used, etc. The question might be an interrogation about
the party’s intentions, might be a riddle, or might be
about a fact somewhere in the dungeon (“What does the
giant statue in the lava pool look like?”).

71-80

The Thing offers a game, or sets a game in motion (shift
over to Game Tricks: see Table 3-108 and following
tables)

81-90

The Thing offers advice. This might be the end of the
show, the main benefit of the trick. The advice might be
vague, might be a poem, might be a riddle, etc. On the
other hand, it might be crucial whether the party follows
the advice … if the advice is “take a duck,” and there’s a
table full of rubber duckies, the party might be surprised
when the giant axe sweeps through the room at neck
level (i.e., you were supposed to duck your head). Often,
however, the advice will be about how to get through an
architectural trick to a treasure, or what the name of the
demon in room 17 is, or which of the two doors to take.

91-00

The Thing provides the ingredients for an Experiment
Trick (shift over to Experiment Tricks starting with
Table 3-87).

Table 3-100: Result of Triggering Action
The distinction between a “trick” and a “trap” (at least for the purpose
of these tables) is that a trick can confer a benefit if treated properly.
Therefore, if the only puzzle or matter of player skill involved is to get
the trick to activate, the result will be a benefit. However, many Magic
Thing tricks are more complex – triggering them is only the first step,
and the test of player skill begins once the trick is activated.
Die Roll

Result of Triggering Action (d100)

01-10

Emits Warning Signal and then activates some sort
of interesting attack, which can be turned off. When
the attack is turned off, the trick gives out a benefit of
some kind. The benefit might go only to the person who
turned off the attack, or might be given to everyone.
Note that if the “Warning Signal” was hitting the party
with some sort of sucker-punch, the sucker-punch is
probably a way of making the party (or certain members) more vulnerable to the interesting attack. Example
of this: when the party triggers the trick, it does two
things; the first is to cast a paralysis spell (which might
take down some of the party members) and then open
up a chute full of giant ants. If you’ve got someone who
can fight through to the chute and close it, you can cut
off the supply of ants. Instead of paralysis, maybe the
trick spat globs of honey before opening the ant-chute.

11-20

Emits Warning Signal and then offers a Choice (see
Table 3-110). Each party member (or a random party
member, or certain party members) gets to pick something. Whether or not you get to play might depend on
your response to the warning signal or whether you were
involved in triggering the trick in the first place.

21-30

Emits Warning Signal and then offers to answer questions (or otherwise gives out useful information). There
might be a price for answering the questions, and the
thing might not mention the price ahead of time.

Table 3-101: Warning Signals - Continued

A warning signal is basically a way of alerting the players that the

annoyed, changed personalities, received a right answer, received a

91-00

Sucker-punch. The trick hits the party or some of the
party with a magical curse, mental condition, or physical harm (including diseases or slow-acting poison).
The name of the game from this point on is to get it to
reverse that condition and hopefully get a benefit as
well. For tricks like this, there is usually no further bad
consequence that can happen – the worst that can happen
is that you’re stuck with the curse, or will die from the
poison, or whatever. Yes, many tricks work this way
BEFORE the party does anything wrong. These tricks
are very much like traps.

Abstract Special Effect. The Thing, or something near
it, produces energy in the form of an Abstract Special

Architectural Change. Something about the surrounding architecture changes. Statues might turn to face one
wall, or to face the characters. A door might appear, a
portcullis might rise, etc. Whatever this is, it needs to
be related to the way the trick delivers its “final blow,”
whether that’s a benefit, a curse, a disease, or whatever.
As an incredibly simple example: if the result of giving
the magic statue the wrong answer to its riddle is going
to be a bunch of fireballs, then one possible architectural change could be the emergence of cannons from
the walls. Feel free to add more subtlety in your own
creations, of course.

having sudden flashes of insight, seeing things closer

emotions).

perhaps the correct action is to ignore the command).

Make physical or indirect contact with the thing

36-40

Mimic the motion of something else that is moving

41-45

Move the thing from one place to another (it might or
might not be significant where it is moved to)

Randomize the Remainder of the Trick. Jot down a table
in your notes, with 2-6 possible warning signals (more
than 6 is probably going overboard). These warning signals should probably all be variations on the same type
– by which I mean, 6 different poems, 6 different sounds,
6 different sucker-punches, 6 different possible changes
in posture, etc. Make each warning signal correspond to
a different reward or threat, a different question that it
asks, a different question that it will answer, etc. When
the party reaches this point in the trick, you will roll
on your table to see what the trick does. IMPORTANT
NOTE: Randomizing a trick is a good idea if the party is
likely to keep coming back to this location, or if you use
this dungeon over and over again with different players,
but it might be overkill if the party is only ever likely to
see the trick do one thing.

46-50

Physically manipulate the thing in some way, by pressing a button, pulling lever, turning knob, etc.

51-55

Place some sort of offering into some sort of container –
this will usually be obvious, such as an offering plate in
front of a giant stone idol.

Pretend (successfully) to be a specific person, not to be
that specific person, or to be the right type of person
(“Yes, I am definitely a dragon! Allow me to enter!”).

Sounds. The Thing makes a sound of some kind (sings,
clanks, screams, etc). You could generate a sound
randomly on Table 3-71, but it’s usually best to pick
something appropriate based on the type of central
feature involved.

86-90

Undertake particular action in area, such as burning
incense, placing gift into bowl, etc.

91-95

Walk a particular pathway through the area

96-00

Walk through the area in any way other than the incorrect path

Light Effect. Eyes, or some other part of the Thing, light
up. Alternatively, something lights up in the surrounding
area. If the area is already lit, then the nature of the lighting changes (color, location, direction, brightness, etc).
Posture Changes. For statues or other representations,
this just means moving, shifting, standing, or sitting. For
static things like pillars or pools, it means turning, rising,
shifting, sliding, or moving contents around (waves or
ripples form in the pool, for instance). If the thing has a
face, changing facial expressions are a possibility.

Speaks Poetry. Produces, speaks, or reveals a poem
(maybe just a rhyming couplet, if you aren’t feeling
Shakespearian enough to whip up a quick sonnet in iambic pentameter). Everyone has an inner poet. Go for it.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - TRICKS

Run-the-Gauntlet and Find-the-Path Tricks
Certain tricks offer a series of risks, but there is a “rule” that can be
followed to get through them safely, or at least with minimal damage.
The trick is to figure out that rule.
A related but more complex type of gauntlet is the one where there
is not a single “rule” for solving it. It is a series of risks in which each
step contains some sort of result – like a game board. In other words,
whether it is obvious to the players or not, they are playing a modified
version of Chutes & Ladders, a modified version of Monopoly, a modified version of chess, a modified version of Candyland, etc. Again, this
will not necessarily be obvious, but it certainly can be.

The defining characteristic of this type of trick is that there are
“safe” and “dangerous” parts of the trick. For a single-rule pathway,
you figure out how to do the whole thing safely, all at once, or else
you fail and do it the stupid, obvious, or wrong way. For a game-board
trick, on the other hand, it is largely random whether you land in the
safe or dangerous areas – unless you, as the adventure designer, add
some element in which the players can affect their movement through
the series.
So, this section offers sets of tables for (1) Single-rule pathways, and
(2) Game-board type pathways.

Single-Rule Pathways
One possibility for gauging reaction time is to give the PLAYERS only a limited amount of time to respond (“you have five minutes to decide”),
counting slowly to five before a bad thing happens, or using some other method to limit the amount of decision-time the players have. Don’t overuse this, though. It is a very high-tension trick, and too much high tension can be as bad as too much low tension.
The artistry in creating a trick like this is to find a Rule of Passage and a Nature of Risk that work well together. They should “feel” right in
combination.

Table 3-103: Single-Rule Pathways
Die Roll

Rule of Passage (d100)

Nature of Risk (d100)

01-10

Jungle gym (doesn’t actually look like a jungle gym, of course).

This is a test of movement through an obstacle course possibly
involving slides, climbing, and getting through crawlways.
Blades. Possibly whirling, possibly moving about randomly,
possibly responding to actions taken by characters.

11-20

Mental test such as riddles. This could include 50-50 chances
– for example, in Alice in Wonderland, Alice is confronted with
a cake that says “Eat me” and a bottle that says “Drink me.”
She is too big to get through the mousehole at her present size,
Falling rocks and floors. This can also involve statues tipping
but guessing correctly whether the labels are trustworthy is one
onto the characters, walls closing in, etc.
example of this sort of trick: the rule is to figure out which food/
drink increases/decreases size, the reward is getting through the
mousehole, and the Risk is “Transformation,” as described in
the next column.

21-30

Random Progression. Characters have to pick one random thing
(card, runestone, roll dice, etc) and face the consequences. Then
they are done, and have gotten through the trick. If the process
repeats more than once, the trick is more in the nature of a
Game Board Pathway (see below).

Monsters. Probably the monsters are themed in some way to the
nature of the gauntlet. They might all be stone-related, elemental-related, woodland-related, undead, etc. The monsters might
or might not be “active” at the beginning of the test. Successive
failures of the Rule of Passage might, for example, keep opening up chutes filled with giant rats.

Figure out which symbol means “safety.”

Rays or bursts of magic with different results. Maybe there is a
floating orb that reacts to movement which continues more than
4 seconds, for instance, if the Rule of Passage is to Move Only
at the Right Time.

41-50

Solve a code which offers the solution

Curses that can be removed on the other side, that stay with
the character for a certain amount of time, that stay with the
character until leaving the dungeon, that stay with the character
until something particular is done in the dungeon (pushing the
eye of the statue, or whatever), or stay with the character until
the curse is removed normally.

51-60

Take cover behind obstacles (possibly having to identify which
things will give adequate cover and which won’t). Possibly, the
characters would need to figure out how to activate the “cover.”
For example, putting a shield into the hands of a statue causes
the statue to block the death rays. There might even be a “trade”
of some kind at each place offering potential cover. Perhaps the
statue doesn’t give back the shield, and the next statue wants
money, and the next statue wants rations, etc.

Transformations. People are turned into something else, and
have to manage to get through the area in that animal (or other)
form. They could also, in some way, be turned into obstacles
that hinder the rest of the group. If the trick is a chessboard
where the only safe way to move is diagonally, a character who
moves straight might be encased in a block of stone that blocks
off his square. If someone reaches the other side, the block of
stone might disappear and release the trapped character. Shrinking or growing would be included here.

Rule of Passage (d100)

Nature of Risk (d100)

61-70

Stand in the right place: certain places are safe and/or profitable, others are dangerous, unprofitable, or subject to the “risk”
defined in the next column. This probably follows a pattern. The
standard example of this would be the task of getting across a
chessboard using only the “bishop’s move” of moving diagonally only.

Falling. In this case, the Rule of Passage is probably linked to
maintaining one’s balance or not having a support give way
beneath them. Bridges over lava pits blocked by a monster with
a big club, green and yellow disks suspended over space, when
the yellow ones are illusionary and the green ones safe … this
sort of thing.

71-80

Use your vehicle properly. Vehicles might have unpredictable
controls, odd defenses, strange capabilities that must be discovered (“We jump when we hit the red button!”), etc.

Vehicles might be very odd ones, or standard ones like rowing
boats or riding a buffalo.
Teleportation or chutes - or alternatively a form of imprisonment - that will temporarily separate the party; probably until
they are re-united when the “survivors” complete the trick. If
cages come down to imprison everyone who doesn’t stand in
the right place at the right time, and the release lever is at the
far side of the room, the party risks having everyone trapped
in cages unless they can figure out when and where to move in
order to avoid being caged.

81-90

Move only at the right time. This would follow a pattern: move
only when the light is green, for example.

Charm or mental domination. Probably this leads to the affected
characters working against the others, but this doesn’t necessarily mean direct combat. This category would also include
insanity and belief in a hallucination or illusion.

91-00

Deactivate the risk. If the risk is coming from a machine with
a red button on it, the solution might be to shoot an arrow that
depresses the button and turns off the machine. Maybe the risk
comes from a bunch of statues which can be de-animated by
pulling a rope located somewhere. Possibilities are endless.

Loss of equipment or possessions. This can be done in many
ways: as wagers, by rusting metal, by statues grabbing things
away, etc.

Game Board Pathways
The “Mode of Forward Movement” table is highly abstract. At first glance it appears that the players are being moved through a game board
such as Chutes & Ladders, Candyland, or Monopoly. However, a true gameboard is only one possibility for a “Game Board Pathway” trick. The
“squares” can be different rooms, different tiers of a pyramid, different disks, the changing possibility for what’s on the other side of a dimensional door, etc.

Table 3-104: Mode of Forward Movement in Game Board Tricks
Die Roll

Mode of Movement (d100)

01-25

Actual dice are rolled to see where the party goes as a group

26-50

Actual dice are rolled to see where individual party members go (in other words, the party gets split up as the game is played)

51-75

The choice or random uncovering of a symbol moves the party to a location matching that symbol. A new choice of symbols might
be presented at each new location. These can be arranged in progressive sets to make sure the party doesn’t keep moving backward
too much. For example, imagine that there are 9 locations, identified with tiles numbered 1-9. At each location, the party draws a
tile to see where they go next. The starting set of tiles only has the possibility to move to locations 1, 2, and 3. Locations 1, 2, and 3
offer a set of tiles between 1 and 4. Eventually the party will thus get to location 4. At location 4, the set of available tiles no longer
includes locations 1-3; now the available set of tiles runs from 4-8. In locations 5-8, there is the possibility of reaching location 9.
Thus the pathway is divided into locations 1-3, 4, 5-8, and 9. Symbols can include anything – runes, playing cards, coins with different denominations, pictorial representations of what is in the various locations, etc.

76-00

In each location along the path, there is particular action the party must take to move forward. Forward movement might be one
“square” at a time; or different actions might allow the party to hop forward more than one “square,” possibly with stupid actions
dropping them backward.

Generating the “Squares.”
Use the results from any board game you have ever played, from Monopoly to Chutes (Snakes) & Ladders. For a complex version of this, you
can use other types of tricks inside this one. An architectural trick might effectively be one of the squares, for example.

If the game board operates with a store of “tokens” that are
used, the square might be a place where they lose some of the
tokens. If the game board does not operate on tokens, this might
be a place where they lose treasure. In this case, the attendant
“risk” is that they cannot proceed without paying what’s effectively a “toll” to move forward.

Get tokens that can be used to advantage in later “squares.”
Tokens could include rune-stones or other items that will not be
perceived as tokens by the characters, even though this is how
they function, in an abstract sense, for purposes of designing a
game board style trick.

of them complete the game’s sequence. Why the party member
must stay behind can be all sorts of reasons. The simple “a cage
falls on you” is the brute force possibility. “You must continue
watering the plant until the others can reach a way to carry it
out” is another possibility, illustrating how wide-ranging this
type of risk can be.

One or more party members are transformed into a stronger
form, related to the game’s theme, which will make them more
able to succeed in the game’s future “squares.” The magic
would evaporate at the end of the game.

81-90

A junction “square” that sends you on a sideline track. The sideline returns to the main track, and might even be a shorter path,
but the “squares” in the sideline track are more dangerous than
the ones on the main path.

A shortcut junction. The pathway forks, and returns to the main
path later, but you don’t have to traverse as many “squares” as
you would if you followed the main pathway.

91-00

A trap, particularly a slow trap in which the players must figure
out how to “turn it off.”

Victory. In other words, the way to win the game board is not
only located at the end of the board, there are ways to win it
along the path itself. There should only be one or two of these.

Substance Tricks
In many cases, the characters will be faced with the problem of coming into contact with a nasty, dangerous-looking, probably disgusting substance.

The substance is the result of a combination; natural seepage of one substance interacts
with the by-products of another activity taking place elsewhere. The chemical (or magical) reaction(s) take place here.

Die Roll

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - TRICKS
Table 3-110: Choice Games
Die Roll

Structure of the “Choice” Game (d100)

01-10

Choose a challenge. Here, the players have to select a type of challenge, rather than a type of reward. There is a reward allocated
to each challenge, but they don’t know what it will be. This turns the game around a bit, because the players will try to pick the
kind of challenge they can beat most easily rather than focusing on the reward. Perhaps the reward is the same for each type of
challenge (if the choices are something like “combat,” “puzzle,” and “trial by water”), or the challenges might be ordered in terms
of increased difficulty for better rewards (choose among, “Zar’s easy challenge,” “Zar’s difficult challenge,” and “Zar’s suicidal
challenge”).

11-20

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good, some are neutral,
and some are dangerous. You only get to choose only once, and you can’t exchange what you got.

21-30

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good, some are neutral,
and some are dangerous. You can take several tries, up to some maximum number.

31-40

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good, some are neutral,
and some are dangerous. You only get to choose only once, BUT you can exchange what you got for something else (probably
only one exchange is allowed). Of course, you run the risk of getting something even worse, if you make an exchange. For games
of this type, the “worst” item should either be disguised as something good (so it’s not returned), should end the game, or should
be the only non-returnable item.

41-50

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). All of the items are useful to some degree,
but some are very useful (magic sword!) and others are pretty disappointing (a pair of socks). You only get to choose only once,
and you can’t exchange what you got.

51-60

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). All of the items – except one – are useful
to some degree, but some are very useful (magic sword!) and others are pretty disappointing (a pair of socks). You can continue
choosing items until someone picks the non-useful item. Then the game is finished. The non-useful item might just be a token that
the game has ended, or it might be cursed (or poisonous, or fill the room with sleep gas, or teleport the party away from the game
room, or whatever).

61-70

Choose blindly from a group of concealed items (invisible, in containers, or whatever). Some items are good, some are neutral, and
some are dangerous. However, taking an item causes you harm (or puts you at risk of taking harm). You can choose as many times
as you want, if you’re willing to take the risks. Example: six bags of treasure sitting on a pedestal, surrounded by six glowing balls
of light. When you take a bag, the corresponding ball of light fires a blast at you. If you can take the damage, take all six bags.
Here’s a possible twist: the pedestal is inscribed with a warning that five of the glowing balls shoot minor bolts, but the sixth one
shoots a death ray. Here’s another possible twist: you might not get to grab one bag, then another, then another. You might have to
choose how many bags you’re going to take at one swipe (and you only get the one swipe).

71-80

Choose from a group of known categories, such as “coins,” “gems,” “monsters,” “spells,” magical items,” etc. What you get
depends on how the trick is designed. Perhaps it always tells lies, and the categories are deceptively or incorrectly named. Perhaps
the result is determined by rolling on a table. Perhaps only one person can pick each category. Perhaps it is set up so that one
person must choose a dangerous-sounding category. Or perhaps it is just a way to let players decide if their reward for “winning” a
trick is going to be cash or potions. Whatever works best.

81-90

Choose from a group of non-concealed items. The items are symbolic representations (or vague pictures) of what the real gift is
going to be, or alternatively you can see the items but not know what their “powers” are, so there is guesswork involved in the
choice. For example, the choice might be among a little sword (you get a magic sword), a slightly bigger sword (which turns out
to be twelve feet long, non-magical, and impossible to lift), a dog figurine (you get a temporary ally), a wolf figurine (wolf attacks
you) and a bottle (which might turn out to be wine, a potion, or just an empty bottle). Keep in mind that these could be deceptive.
The ominous “skull” picture might get you a talking skull who knows where lots of treasure is kept.

91-00

Choose once, blindly, from a set of options. Each option might be good, bad, or neutral. You can’t trade them in or get a second
try, but each option comes with a little clue. The clue, if it is interpreted properly, will let you improve the thing you chose in some
way. A cursed item might be neutralized, a neutral item become valuable, and a good item become better (or last longer, or affect
more people, etc). But to get that benefit you have to answer the riddle on the container, or find where “the fire meets the eagle”
somewhere in the dungeon, or some other type of challenge or task.

Table 3-113: Types of Game Series
Die Roll

Game Series (d100)

01-10

Make a list of six or ten beneficial magical conditions (Table 3-118) and curses (also Table 3-118) in a proportion of 60-40 benefits to backfires. Each time the trick is used, roll a die to determine the effect. The effects are “used up” once they are rolled,
and if the same number is re-rolled, the result is “no effect.” A character can only try the trick one time. A second attempt to use
the trick results in a curse from Table 3-118. It is up to the referee to determine whether the curses are minor compared to the
benefits, if they are about the same scale, or if the curses are significant and the benefits considerable.

11-20

As above, but the ratio of benefits to curses is higher, about 80-20. The negative effects of the curses might, however, be greater.

21-30

As above, but instead of “using up” the effects, it is possible to get the same effect twice.

31-40

As above, but when an effect is used it is replaced by a (fairly minor) curse that substitutes for the original effect.

41-50

As above, but instead of rolling a single die (a linear probability curve) the referee rolls 3d6 or some other combination of dice
and adds the results together. Thus, certain results are more probable than others.

51-60

Unlike the above, the game series is based on a series of die rolls, following the rules of craps (possibly disguised in some way by
an innovative referee).

61-70

Unlike the above, the game series is like a slot machine. The referee (or even the player, depending on the trick) rolls 3d6. Each
number corresponds to a picture (either little cherries or lemons like in a slot machine, or tarot card pictures for something more
sinister). Combinations of various numbers (three threes, for example) have a certain payoff. For a game series like this, each
character should only be allowed to play once, unless it costs something to play.

71-80

Unlike the above, the game series might be a die roll “race,” possibly represented by little figures on a track. The character might
pull a lever and the referee rolls a die to see how far the character’s “man” moves. Then the referee rolls for the other side. If the
character gets his man to the finish line first, he gets a benefit. There might be a backfire if he loses. Think of various carnival
games for ideas on how this might look.

81-90

The character is allowed to attempt a task similar to some sort of carnival game (other than a straight-up race, as described above).
This might be a to-hit roll in an attempt to throw a ring over a prize, just like a ring toss. The player might have choices over what
to aim for, with the more desirable prizes being harder to gain. Failure might incur a backfire – if not, there should be some cost
to play, or each character should be limited to only one attempt.

91-00

The game series might be some other sort of game, such as a card game, played in real life between the referee and the player.
These should be extremely short (rock, paper, scissors, for example), or they will bore ot her players very quickly.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - TRICKS
Table 3-116: Beneficial Effect of Reading the Written Trick
Written tricks with a purely negative effect are basically traps. In general,
if the trick is hard to read, don’t also make it misinformation. The one exception to this rule is when one set of writing is truthful (say, the guy with
the bad handwriting) and one is false (the guy with the good handwriting is
a liar). In this case, once the party has figured this out, knowing which set
of information should be helpful down the road: they can get major clues
when they find future notes written in bad handwriting. A random mix of
truth and lies, with no way to judge which is which, can be frustrating
rather than fun. And then, of course, there are exceptions to every rule!

Magical Conditions
And Curses
Many of the above tables refer to Beneficial Magical Conditions and
their opposite, Curses. These tables offer suggestions for designing
such results.

Table 3-118: Type of Beneficial Magical Condition or Curse

Die Roll

Content (d100)

01-20

Deliberately reading the picture/characters/words causes
a magical benefit to the reader (see Table 3-121 for
ideas)

21-40

Simply viewing the picture/characters/words causes a
magical benefit to the reader (see Table 3-121 for ideas)

41-60

The picture/characters/words convey helpful information in the form of a map (10%) or other information
(roll on Table 3-17 Information Content for Rumors).

61-80

The trick is to decipher or be able to view or interpret
the message contained in a form of Unusual Writing (see
Table 3-117 below).

81-00

The written trick gives instructions that must be immediately followed; following the instructions gains a
magical benefit from Table 3-121 (or, possibly, allows
survival of something nasty that suddenly happens) –
ignoring the instructions causes a curse (see Table 3-118
for ideas) or a trap result. For example, if you read
“jump to the left” on a sign, it might be a good idea to
jump to the left. On the other hand, perhaps it’s actually
a trap and there’s a pit to the left. Life is unfair.

Traps
Traps, Generally

Table 3-126: Basic Mechanical Traps - Continued

Traps are divided into basic traps, which usually offer a single type
of risk, and complex traps, which involve more than just the “trigger
+ result” profile of a basic trap. Basic mechanical traps, without any
sort of complicated trigger, are the classic “hallway traps.” When they
are concealed in items or have complicated triggers, basic mechanical
traps are the staple form of a “room trap.” Rigged natural features (a
basic trap), and all complex traps, are more unusual – but they can be
some of the most memorable parts of a dungeon level as long as they
aren’t overused. Too many traps can spoil a dungeon adventure by
slowing the characters (and the pace of the adventure) down to a slow
and boring crawl.

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - TRAPS
Table 3-127: Mechanical traps – Concealment, Complicated Triggers
Not every mechanical trap will have a complicated trigger: most will operate by pressure plates and tripwires.
Die Roll

Trap Concealment (d100)

Complicated Trigger (d100)

01-02

Alcove

A chemical requires a certain level of coolness to remain inactive. Nearby flames (such as
torches) cause it to react and activate the trap

03-04

Altar

A chemical requires a certain level of heat to remain inactive. Shadows cause it to react and
activate the trap

05-06

Aquarium

A coating of grease covers a substance that heats up when exposed to air; if the grease is smeared,
the heat of the chemical reaction activates the trap

07-08

Barrel or cask

A feather is suspended over a very delicate pressure plate. If it is blown down by air currents, it
will activate the trap when it lands (so would other very light objects)

09-10

Bath or basin

A glass globe (possibly quite small) contains a chemical that is highly reactive when exposed to
air. If the globe breaks (and is still in the right place) the heat of the chemical reaction activates
the trap

11-12

Bed

A hanging object or an object resting on the floor holds down a vertical tripwire. If the object
is removed, the tripwire flies into the ceiling (probably due to a counterweight) and the trap is
activated

13-14

Book

A highly reactive powder is located upon a heat sensor of some kind. Body heat, oils in skin, or
exhaled carbon dioxide concentrations (three different triggers, here) cause the powder to react
and activate the heat sensor or burn through a thread

15-16

Bookshelves

A part of the item can be moved, and contains a lever that activates the trap

17-18

Box or crate

Acid container tips onto string; when spring snaps, trap is activated

19-20

Bridge

Acid container tips onto string; when spring snaps, trap is activated

21-22

Cabinet

Beam of light (possibly invisible, possibly not, possibly visible only with unusual type of vision)
has a “photoreceptor”: if the beam of light is broken, the trap is activated

23-24

Carpet or rug

Beam of light (possibly invisible, possibly not, possibly visible only with unusual type of vision)
has a “photoreceptor.” Something blocks the beam of light, but if that item is moved, the light
will hit the photoreceptor and activate the trap

25-26

Ceiling hook

Beam of light (possibly invisible, possibly not, possibly visible only with unusual type of vision)
has a “photoreceptor”: if the beam of light is broken, the trap is activated

27-28

Chair or throne

Beam of light (possibly invisible, possibly not, possibly visible only with unusual type of vision)
has a “photoreceptor.” Something blocks the beam of light, but if that item is moved, the light
will hit the photoreceptor and activate the trap

29-30

Chest

Blade cuts twine if moved

31-32

Corpse

Blade cuts twine if moved

33-34

Dais, platform or stage

Change-up. A hammer is held suspended by a latch, which, if opened will cause the hammer to
strike an obvious pressure plate. That pressure plate HAS to be hit in order to temporarily deactivate another, hidden, pressure plate in the floor. The pressure plate in the floor is the one that
activates a trap.

35-36

Desk

Flint sparks a trail of flammable powder to the triggering poin

37-38

Display case

Flint sparks a trail of flammable powder to the triggering point

39-40

Door

Guitar-type string, if plucked, establishes a frequency that breaks a little sliver of glass, activating
the trap

41-42

Door hinges

Latch releases gears to begin moving, if the latch is accidentally pulled off its holder

43-44

Doorknob or latch

Latch releases gears to begin moving, if the latch is accidentally pulled off its holder

45-46

Fireplace

Piece of tubing contains gas or liquid under pressure. The pressure keeps the trap from functioning; if a stopper is removed (possibly attached to a wire or chain), the pressure is removed and the
trap activates. Same result if the tubing is broken or pierced.

47-48

Flagstone in floor

Pin (like that of a grenade) hold trap from functioning unless it is pulled from its socket

49-50

Forge or anvil

Pin (like that of a grenade) hold trap from functioning unless it is pulled from its socket

51-52

Fountain

Pressure plate with weight on it releases when weight removed

53-54

Idol or statue

Pressure plate with weight on it releases when weight removed

55-56

Jar, pot, urn

Pressure plate with weight on it releases when weight removed

57-58

Ladder

Pressure plate: when depressed, the trap is activated

59-60

Pillar or column

Sliding bolt keeps hidden gears from moving unless the bolt is pulled from its socket

75-76

Pool

Sliver of blown glass contains a light beam or a corrosive liquid that activates the trap if the piece
of glass is broken

77-78

Portcullis

Something is delicately balanced upon a button. If it falls, the removal of weight lifts a pin and
activates the trap

79-80

Railing

Spring releases trap

81-82

Ramp

Spring releases trap

83-84

Stairs

Trap is located on a balanced “seesaw” with another counterweight; if either item is removed, the
seesaw will press onto a trigger and activate the trap

Internal damage (increasing): if the victim fails a saving
throw, he suffers internal damage and has a 10% chance
of dying when he next takes damage from a wound,
spell, fall, or other source of hit point damage. The next
wound has a 15% chance of killing him, the next wound
a 20% chance, and so on. (A stronger poison might have
a higher initial chance of death or cumulate at more than
5% per wounding).

31-32

Damage (lethal quantity): causes hit point damage each
round for a predetermined number of rounds; saving
throw avoids effects completely

57-58

Internal damage (lethal): if the victim fails a saving

of dying each time he takes damage from a wound, spell,
fall, or other source of hit point damage. (A stronger
poison might have a higher chance of death).

Internal damage (saving throw/level based - progressive): if the victim fails a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and must make a saving throw every time he
suffers damage from another source. Failing the saving
throw indicates that the damage caused by the poison
causes death (from a weakened artery, stomach lining,
etc). Each saving throw has a cumulative –1 penalty.

another source. Failing the saving throw indicates that
the damage caused by the poison causes death (from a
weakened artery, stomach lining, etc).

63-64

43-44

Damage from activity: failed saving throw means the
character takes a certain number of hit points damage
per hour, but physical exertion (moving, fighting, spell
casting) causes additional damage per combat round.

Lethal (don’t eat): failed saving throw means the character has a 25% chance of dying every time he eats

65-66

Lethal (don’t eat): failed saving throw means the character will die the next time he eats food

67-68

Lethal (don’t sleep): failed saving throw means the
character has a 25% chance of dying whenever he sleeps
unless the poison is reversed.

69-70

Lethal (don’t sleep): failed saving throw means the
character will succumb to the poison and die when he
next sleeps.

71-72

Lethal (stay out of the sun): failed saving throw means
the character takes damage from sunlight (some number
of points per hour’s exposure) and those hit points cannot be healed unless the poison itself is removed from
the system.

73-74

Lethal, delayed by level: failed saving throw means that
the character will die in a number of combat rounds
equal to his level.

75-76

Lethal, delayed by level: failed saving throw means that
the character will die in a number of hours equal to his
level.

77-78

random number of hours

85-86

Lethal: Instant death; saving throw avoids effects completely

87-88

Lethal: Instant death; successful saving throw means
damage but not death

45-46

Damage from activity: failed saving throw means the
character takes a certain number of hit points damage per
hour, but physical exertion (moving, fighting, spell casting)
requires an additional saving throw to avoid instant death.

47-48

Damage from spell casting: failed saving throw means
the character takes a certain number of hit points damage per hour (eventually lethal, but very slow), but also
takes hit point damage whenever he casts a spell (probably dependent on the power of the spell). None of the
damage caused by spell casting can be healed unless the
poison is removed from the system.

49-50

Experience Point Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw
means that character loses a particular number of
experience points every hour until reaching 0 (death).
The more lethal the poison, the higher the number of
experience points lost each hour. Experience point loss
is permanent unless restored.

51-52

Experience Point Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw
means that character loses a particular number of experience points every hour until reaching 0 (death). The
more lethal the poison, the higher the number of experience points lost each hour. Experience points return (at
some rate) if the poison is neutralized.

53-54

Internal damage (ability score based): if the victim fails
a saving throw, he suffers internal damage and must
make a “check” against his constitution score every
time he suffers damage from another source. Failing
the check (rolling higher than the ability score on a d20)
indicates that the damage caused by the poison causes
death (from a weakened artery, stomach lining, etc).

Effect of Lethal Poison (d100)

89-90

Level Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that
the character loses a level and continues to lose more
levels (perhaps one per day) until reaching 0 (death).
Level loss is permanent unless the levels are restored.
Note: levels tend to be associated with life force, so
this sort of poison would likely be associated with the
undead, planes of shadow, or other such supernatural
forces. Mere loss of memory would be better addressed
with a poison that erodes experience points rather than
experience levels

91-92

Level Erosion (lethal): failed saving throw means that
the character loses a level and continues to lose more
levels (perhaps one per day) until reaching 0 (death).
Levels are regained (at some rate) if the poison is neutralized.

Note that “mental” effects of poisons are short term – that would indicate insanity, which is much more linked with magic than poisons
are – a “poison” is something that works non-magically. Magical poisons should be thought of as potions, and dreamed up using that kind
of mental framework, so you don’t accidentally blend all your types
of threats together. When all types of threats can result in all types
of consequences, you have removed the unique nature of “poison” vs.
“curse,” vs. “disease,” etc. Physical effects can generally be short term
(very weak poisons, or the side effect of making a saving throw against
a very strong poison) or long term (probably the result of failing a save
– long term effects as an automatic minimum result of poison would
indicate a poison of quasi-mythical potency and will understandably
tick off your players).

93-94

Die Roll

Percentile chance of death (eroding): Each hour, the
victim has a percentage chance of dying instantly (the
percentile chance corresponding to the strength of the
poison). The percentile chance increases each hour.
Example: if the victim fails a saving throw, he has a 10%
chance of dying immediately; if he survives, he must
make a check every subsequent hour, with the first check
at 15%, the second check at 20%, etc.

95-96

Percentile chance of death: Each hour, the victim has
a percentage chance of dying instantly (the percentile
chance corresponding to the strength of the poison).

97-98

Saving throw checks (eroding): a failed saving throw
means the character starts the process of dying, but can
stave it off for a while – each hour, the character must
make a saving throw or die instantly. Also, each hour, a
cumulative –1 penalty is added to that die roll.

99-00

Saving throw checks: a failed saving throw means the
character starts the process of dying, but can stave it off
for a while – each hour, the character must make a saving throw or die instantly.

Basic Traps (Rigged Natural Features)
The above trap tables are great for generating a huge variety of mechanical traps, but sometimes a trap is constructed by taking advantage of an
already existing, inherently dangerous feature of the terrain – and making it more dangerous for people who don’t know the right way to handle it.
For traps like these, roll on the following table (which is a repeat of one of the trick tables, but used differently):

Something affects sense of direction, sense of sight, or physical balance in or near the danger zone; to make damage more
likely, or to prolong exposure to damage

91-95

Venting steam, bad air, or dangerous gases

A “safe” path only works for the first couple of people, after
which it becomes dangerous or impassable

96-00

Another danger acts to herd the party into the natural danger
zone (lightning strikes, hordes of rats, roiling gas, etc).

Basic Traps (Magical)
Magical traps are those with a non-mechanical effect or a non-mechanical trigger. In addition to the trap’s actual effect, there will often be some
sort of special effect that goes with it (See Table 3-136).

BOOK THREE: DUNGEON DESIGN - TRAPS

Complex Traps
Complex traps are traps with four or even five elements.
The Draw: This first stage might or might not be present; it is a mechanism that brings the party into the area where the trap can take effect and/
or triggers the trap.
The Prison: The second stage is virtually always present; an element that holds the characters in place or in a particular location.
The Kill Mechanism: The third stage is an element that kills them slowly in that location.
The Kill-switch: The fourth element, which is virtually always present in a slow-kill trap, is a kill switch or mechanism of escape.
The Complication: The fifth element, which will not always be present, is a distraction or complication.

Certain party members are trapped in
different time-speeds, caught in other dimensions (although still visible), or stasis
fields separate the party.

84-92

Party is swallowed by something (architectural, demonic, or even animal).
Alternatively, powerful monsters (or even
invulnerable ones) that don’t attack (probably constructs, elementals, or undead)
move to guard the exit. They might respond
if pushed; this isn’t as unfair as it sounds –
remember, they are serving as a wall, and
walls are essentially invulnerable, too.

Powerful monsters emerge and push the
party members into cells (or something
equivalent), then leave. It’s possible but
highly unlikely the party can beat them,
but the monsters don’t actually attack,
either. Undead or constructed monsters
work best for this. The other possibility
is a virtually unbeatable horde of lesser
monsters that also don’t actually attack,
just put the party into the cells.

Stunning by loud noise, horrid sight,
physical blow, etc.

affected by other measurement such as drop in
ability score, hit points, or experience points
down toward death.

Objects are pushed into room one at a
time. Eventually there won’t be more
room, and anyone inside will be crushed
as more objects are forced in.

Dangerous liquids (boiling water,
slime, etc) squirt or pour into
certain parts of the area at random
intervals.

81-90

A series of “steps,” each associated with a
greater level of inability to act (e.g., laughter
causing lower ability to mess with the escape
hatch). Characters move to the next step based
on periodical saving throws, percentile chances,
or ability checks.

An obviously deadly mechanism in the
middle of the area is counting down until
it operates – as shown by an hourglass or
some other way of communicating the
slow building-up of the threat.

Flames, electricity, or blasts of
frost shoot into random areas at
random intervals

91-00

Periodical loss of hit points, random number
each time

Really dangerous monster (like a demon)
slowly begins to coalesce in the area

Spears or very long spikes stick
out into the area at random

Table 3-141: Kill-Switches and Escape Hatches
A kill-switch is a way of turning off a trap, either before it springs or
once it is already in operation. In slow-killing traps, it can be a matter
of life or death to figure out how the kill-switch operates (or where it
is). Escape hatches usually have to be figured out or found as well, but
instead of turning off the trap, they allow people to exit before being
killed or harmed.
Die Roll

Working the Kill-switch (d100)

01-25

Use the Architectural Trick tables (Table 3-84 or 3-85)

26-50

Use the Unusual Mechanism table (Table 3-32)

51-75

Treat the kill-switch as a Wager Trick (Table 3-108)

76-99

There is a Magical Thing trick in the area where the
characters are trapped, and it has a way to let them out
(Table 3-97 and following tables)

00

Unusual Method: Flip coin each round until “tails”
comes up, player draws a card each round until getting a
spade, player draws card each round until the results total 50, game of rack/paper/scissors, or any other method
you can dream up. This can add a lot of spice to a tense
situation.

Magically-Induced Weakness (d100)

03-04

Adhesiveness and Friction. Magical adhesiveness or
slipperiness is involved with the trap as a secondary
feature.

05-06

Affect Ground or Rock. Rock might be turning to
mud (or changing back), or some other magical effect is
working upon the stone in the area while the characters
try to escape.

07-08

Affect Metal. Magical properties of the trap are affecting
metal while the characters try to escape. This could include causing the metal to animate, affecting it as a magnet, making it rust, heating it up, chilling it to deadly low
temperatures, causing it to conduct electricity, shaping it
at will, making it brittle, changing its physical properties,
causing it to constrict, or some combination thereof.

09-10

Affect Wood. The trap can animate wooden items, causing them to attack the party.

11-12

Affect Wood. The trap’s properties, magical or alchemical) affect wood in such a way as to make it brittle or
bend it. If the means of escaping the trap involve
something made of wood, this might create a serious race
against time.

13-14

Affects the Use of Limbs. Whether it is because of
extreme cold, a spell, or some other magical means, it is
difficult to use one’s limbs while trapped, and it becomes
more difficult as time passes. This could be due to anything from a clumsiness curse, to confusion, to intense
cold, to twitching movements.

15-16

Animate Objects. The trap includes some objects that
animate and attack the party.

Magically-Induced Weakness (d100)

01-02

Acid Damage Magical acid is involved with the trap as a
secondary feature or complication. If the victim fails some
sort of check (morale, saving throw, percentile chance, etc)
he may be subject to such things as (1) becoming unable to
act due to pain, (2) becoming temporarily blind, (3) having
his equipment damaged, or (4) taking normal damage.

43-44

Distracting Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing
feature that is really distracting, causing problems for the
characters as they try to escape, fight, etc.

17-18

Asphyxiation. The magical part of the trap removes
or reduces the target’s ability to breathe. Death is not
immediate, and the period of time required for the victim
to die can be measured out in several ways (see Table
3-143 (Measuring out Life) or Table 3-128 (Effects of
Gas). Don’t worry if the character seems to be able to
hold his breath for an incredibly long time – just assume
that he manages to catch a gasp of air somehow during
the process.

45-46

Electrical Damage. The trap causes progressive electrical damage to the target, or small repeated electrical
attacks. There may also be an additional result involved
after a certain point, or if a saving throw fails – possibilities include: random actions for some number of rounds,
loss of bodily coordination, mental disorientation, temporary paralysis, etc.

47-48

Fear. The trap causes magical fear, paralyzing or keeping the affected character from acting (to some degree).

49-50

Fire. The trap includes a magical fire feature – if the
victim fails some sort of check (morale, saving throw,
percentile chance, etc) he reflexively takes some action
in response to the fire. These could include: panic for
a couple of combat rounds, trying to put out the fire, or
writhing in pain. It might be that the “check” becomes
more difficult as time passes.

51-52

Hallucinations or Illusions. The trap includes magically or drug-induced hallucinations.

53-54

Ice. Magical ice plays a role in the trap, either immobilizing, causing damage, or being slippery.

55-56

Immobilization. Magical immobilization might include
dancing, twitching, laughing, vomiting, nausea, confusion, jumping, floating, talking, scratching, begging for
mercy, thinking, arguing, holding one’s breath, hiding,
and meditating.

57-58

Implant Eggs or Larva. While everything else is going on, the trap is trying to inject eggs or larva into the
characters, which will distract them from other parts of
the trap.

59-60

Insanity. The trap includes a progressive risk of magically induced insanity.

61-62

Intelligence Loss. The trap slowly drains intellect from
the victims while they are trying to escape. The effect
is probably temporary, but if intelligence is the key to
surviving the other features of the trap, this could be a
nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

63-64

Light, Dark, and Shadow. The trap involves magical
light, dark, or shadow to cause a threat to the trapped
characters, or to make it more difficult to escape.

65-66

Luck. The characters in the trap become progressively
more unlucky (probably a temporary effect, but a trap
is not the place where you want to suddenly become
unlucky).

67-68

Magic Drain (spells). The trap progressively drains
away spell power.

69-70

Magic Force. Some sort of magical force pushes or
pulls the characters while they are trying to deal with the
rest of the trap.

71-72

Magical Vortex. Mist, smoke, steam, vapor, fog, or
some other kind of gas moves in a powerful whirlwind
or series of gusts. The substance might be poisonous,
might be choking, might be hot, might be cold, might
conduct electricity, might dispel magic, or could have
any number of other properties. It might not necessarily
fill the entire area where the characters are trapped, but
would probably move around in that case.

19-20

Aversion. The magical part of the trap tries to create an
aversion to something that is in the trap with the characters. If they “catch” the aversion, it will make it more
difficult to handle the rest of the trap.

21-22

Body Infestation. The trap infests the victim’s body
with a plant or animal growth

23-24

Burial. If it is not already a feature of the trap, the trap
keeps trying to bury the characters in some substance as
they try to escape.

25-26

Clumsiness. If affected, the characters in the trap suffer one or more of the following effects: a penalty to
hit, a penalty to armor class, inability or reduction in
spell casting, and/or the chance to drop any items they
are holding. Actual dexterity score is not necessarily
affected. The way in which the trap causes clumsiness
could include overloading one of the victim’s emotions
(joy, rage, hate, greed, fear); an alchemical reaction
(mysterious chemicals in the waters of the trap); the
effects of tiny but continual electrical shocks; or a very
weak poison, curse, or disease.

27-28

Cold Damage. Increasing cold causes progressive
damage (or it becomes progressively harder to avoid
damage).

29-30

Compelling Sound. The trap includes a sound-causing
feature that tries to magically compel the characters to
do something, or stop doing something. The longer they
are exposed, the more difficult it becomes to avoid the
compulsion.

31-32

Constitution Loss. The trap slowly drains constitution
from the victims while they are trying to escape. The
effect is probably temporary, but if constitution is the key
to surviving the other features of the trap, this could be a
nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

33-34

Dehydrate, Desiccate, Suck Fluids. Some magical
feature of the trap sucks blood or dehydrates the victim
(possibly all the way into powder).

35-36

Despondency. The trap causes intense despondency
or lethargy, which may keep the characters from even
attempting to escape if they are affected or exposed long
enough.

37-38

Dexterity Loss. The trap slowly drains dexterity from the
victims while they are trying to escape. The effect is probably temporary, but if quick hands or graceful movement
is the key to surviving the other features of the trap, this
could be a nasty “kicker” to the trap’s overall lethality.

39-40

Dimensional Features. This type of magical trap
feature taps other dimensions of time and space to screw
around with the movement or other abilities of the
trapped characters.

41-42

Disease. The trap causes a fast-acting disease that gets
progressively worse while in the trap.

Overload Senses. Some feature of the trap is trying to
cause an overload of one or all of the senses, and getting
stronger.

81-82

Paralysis. Some feature of the trap can cause magical paralysis, and it might be getting more powerful (or
progressively weakening the characters’ ability to fight
it off.

83-84

Progressively Damaging Sound. The trap includes a
sound-causing feature that causes a low but increasing
level of damage.

85-86

Rage. The trap causes rage, either in a series of steps
or determined when a saving throw fails. Characters
affected by the rage will probably not be much help in
escaping the situation.

87-88

Size and Density. The size or density of the characters
is being slowly changed while they are in the trap.

81-85

Until series of “attribute checks” finally fails (cumulative penalty added each time)

Sleep or Catatonia. The trap presents an increasing risk
of magical sleep or catatonia.

86-90

rolls fails

91-92

Slow. The trap progressively slows down the trapped
characters.

91-95

93-94

Weakness. Some part of the trap induces magical weakness. This might or might not include progressive loss of
strength points as well.

Until series of percentile (or other x in y chance) die
rolls fails, with chance reducing each time or with a
cumulative penalty added each time.

96-00

Until series of saving throws fails (cumulative penalty
added each time)

95-96

Stun. Something about the trap can stun victims if they
fail periodical saving throws against the effect.

97-98

Telekinesis and Teleportation. Items are flying or
teleporting around the area, or some other teleportation
or telekinetic effect is used to cause problems.

99-00

Transformation. While the characters are in the trap
they are also slowly being changed into something else.

Other Unusual Feature (d100)

Other Unusual Feature (d100)

Hallucinogens might be encountered in the campaign at large, or
might be encountered in the dungeon as a very subtle feature combining
the effects of a potion and a poison. A simple hallucinogen simply gives
the character pleasure (with no particular game effect), coupled with
addiction. A more complex hallucinogen would grant an actual gamebenefit to the character such as insights or strength, but would have
increasingly negative side effects as time went on. If a powerful spell
were required to end the addiction, it might be of temporary advantage
to the character to actually maintain the addiction (with both its positive
and increasingly negative effects) until it becomes cost-effective to pay
for the curing (or the party’s cleric gains enough levels to cast the spell).

Attribute Gain: while the

to the point where it creates
a bonus or other benefit

Frequent and increasing need for sleep affects
normal performance as a
character if it isn’t met.

Hit point gain: while the
character is under the influence of the drug, he or she
is capable of taking more
damage than normal.

Increasing episodes of confusion, possibly to the point
where a spell caster cannot
always succeed at casting a
spell, or a fighter cannot reliably make attacks in any
particular combat round.

Berserk attacks or a
“danger sense” that gives
the character some sort of
benefit in combat – some
of these might also have
a negative effect: berserk
attacking usually makes
the character easier to hit
as well as being able to hit
more effectively.

Sarcophagi and their Contents
A few points about sarcophagi as they are used in dungeon-adventure design. There are some rooms in which opening sarcophagi is like opening a
box of chocolates – you never know what you’re going to get. In rooms like
this, most or all of the sarcophagi will be identical, or there might be “types”
that can be identified by some hint in the decorations. The ones with red stone
patterns might contain ghouls, while the ones with blue stone patterns might
contain treasure. A second type of sarcophagus room contains a couple of
highly distinctive ones – there might be some of the “box of chocolate” ones,
but the central feature is the one or two very unusual ones.

Notes (Do not roll dice)

Agate

A form of chalcedony. When cut, agates
often show beautiful banding and stripes;
these are called striped agate. Agate can also
be the mineral which forms a fossil.

Agate Geode

Rock nodules containing agate inside. These
can be dramatic when cut open, but since
they make a bowl shape when cut, and have
unremarkable rock on the outside, they would
not ordinarily be used as personal jewelry.

Amber

Fossilized tree resin. Amber can come in many
colors, usually with a yellowish cast. Blue
amber exists, and is the rarest form. Amber
occasionally contains insects that were trapped
in the resin and fossilized along with it.

07-08

Amethyst
(Purple)

A variety of quartz. It can be carved, and
since it was believed by the Romans to prevent drunkenness, they carved it into cups.

09-10

Amethyst
(Yellow)

A yellow form of amethyst.

11-12

Apatite

Green and blue colored apatite are used as
gemstones. The stone can occasionally be
chatoyant (i.e., a cat’s-eye appearance).

13-14

Aquamarine

A blue form of beryl.

15-16

Beryl

Pure beryl is transparent; when it contains
impurities, these give it color. Colored
forms of beryl have other names – emeralds and aquamarine are both forms of
beryl.

17-18

Bloodstone

A dark green chalcedony flecked with
spots of red jasper. It is also often called
Heliotrope.

19-20

Carnelian

A red form of chalcedony.

21-22

Chalcedony

A somewhat translucent gemstone with a
waxy-looking surface. Several other gemstones are forms of chalcedony.

23-24

25-26

Coral

Coral can be carved and polished to create a
wide variety of shapes and figures. The range
of colors covers the entire spectrum.

27-28

Diamond

Most diamonds are clear, but impurities can
result in diamonds of almost any color –
these are rarer than clear diamonds.

Precious
Stone (d100)

Diamond
(Black)

Black diamonds don’t exist in the real world,
so they are fabulously rare in fantasy worlds

63-64

Obsidian

Volcanic glass. Obsidian is dark colored,
and can be used to make very sharp edges.

Diamond
(Blue)

Blue diamonds. These result from boron
impurities, but the important thing is that
they are rarer (more valuable) than normal
diamonds.

65-66

Onyx

A form of banded quartz.

Opal

Emerald

The green form of beryl. Emeralds are rare
and valuable.

Opal ranges widely in color, although the
red and black ones are rare. Opals have
lots of internal colors all together, which is
very unusual.

69-70

Opal (Black)

Feldspar

A very common mineral, but some forms
of it are lustrous and attractive. Moonstone is a form of feldspar, and virtually
all valuable feldspar would be a form of
moonstone.

Black opals are the rarest kind of opal.
They still have other colors within the
stone, the rarest combination being black
and red.

71-72

Opal (Fire)

Fire opal would be the reverse of a black
opal, predominantly red with internal black
colorations.

73-74

Pearl

Formed in oysters. They can have a wide
range of rarity based on color and shape.
Sea pearls are also rarer than freshwater
ones. Mollusks other than oysters can
produce pearls, and some of these can be
quite valuable.

75-76

Pearl (Black)

Black pearls are very rare; they do exist in
the real world.

77-78

Pearl (Purple) A rare color of sea pearl

67-68

37-38

Garnet

A fairly common mineral, but some forms
of it are rarer and interesting. Some forms of
garnet change color depending on the light;
for example, one type changes from a bluegreen all the way to purple. Garnets come in
a variety of colors; red, yellow, brown, etc.
There is a blue type, which is the rarest.

39-40

Golden Beryl

A golden yellow form of beryl, often called
Heliodore.

Hematite

Hematite is a metal, a form of iron oxide,
which varies from steel-colored to black,
to red. Powdered hematite dust can be fatal
if inhaled, and was used as a trap in an
ancient Egyptian tomb.

41-42

Ivory

Ivory comes from tusks, and can be carved
and polished.

45-46

Jade (Black)

Doesn’t actually exist, so very valuable in
a fantasy world.

47-48

Jade (Blue)

A blue form of jade.

49-50

Jade (Green)

The most valuable form of jade (with the
exception of black jade, which doesn’t exist in the real world).

51-52

Jasper

Opaque chalcedony that has been polished.
Colors range around red, yellow, brown and
green, but there is also a rarer blue type.

Lapis Lazuli

A blue, relatively rare semi-precious stone.
A lot of lapis was used in the jewelry
found in Tutankhamen’s tomb.

43-44

53-54

Notes (Do not roll dice)

79-80

Peridot

An olive-green gemstone that only occurs
in this one color. They can easily be mistaken for emeralds. Interestingly, peridot
has been found in meteorites.

81-82

Quartz
(Rose)

A particular color of quartz.

83-84

Quartz
(Smoky)

A particular color of quartz

85-86

Ruby

Ruby, emerald, sapphire, and diamond are
the four true precious stones. Rubies are
the same mineral as sapphires, but they are
the ones running from pink to dark red.

87-88

Sapphire

One of the four true precious stones, sapphires are a form of corundum which can
be any color other than pink or red (which
are considered rubies).

89-90

Sapphire
(White)

There is no such thing as a white sapphire,
so these would be much more valuable
than ordinary sapphires, which are already
quite valuable.

91-92

Tiger’s Eye

A form of quartz that is “chatoyant,” meaning that it looks like there is an eye.

55-56

Malachite

A vibrant green, relatively common stone.

57-58

Moonstone

A form of feldspar which looks pearl-like
and reflects light, vaguely, from inside the
stone.

59-60

Moss Agate

Agate that contains filament-like patterns of
other minerals. These look like plant material, giving the stone the “moss” name.

93-94

Topaz (any)

Pure topaz is colorless

95-96

Topaz (blue)

Blue topaz is the rarest color of topaz

97-98

Tourmaline

A semi-precious stone that can be found in
almost any color, including colorless.

Mother of
Pearl

Pearl-like deposits, very common. The
value of a piece of mother-of-pearl would
depend almost entirely upon the quality
with which it was carved, not the value of
the mother-of-pearl itself. However, a really big piece would have to have come from
a giant clam or oyster (rarer), and weirdly
shaped fantasy mollusks could also create
weirdly-shaped pieces of mother-of-pearl,
and these would also be relatively rare.

Turquoise
(various
colors)

Lower-quality turquoise is fairly common,
but higher quality specimens can be very
valuable indeed. Egypt and Persia were the
first major sources of turquoise. The stone
can be blue, green or red, and often has
veins of color running through it.

The previous three books contain tables designed to spark ideas: the
first book addressed missions and villainous plans, the second book
focuses on monsters, and the third book focuses on constructing a dungeon adventure. This fourth book provides tables for non-dungeon adventures – castles, ruins, forests, other dimensions, and others.

The patterns listed here also apply to dungeon adventures, but when
designing wilderness or other types of adventures it is often more
important than with dungeon adventures to step back and look at the
overall structure of what you’re putting together. The reason is that
in a dungeon, so many possibilities are hardwired into the map: you
can’t go up or down unless the map allows it, your visibility is limited,
and there are only a limited number of pathways. In a wilderness or
non-dungeon adventure, you have to give some thought to the broader
possibilities (both the advantages and disadvantages) involved.

Physical reconnaissance followed by an assault.
Physical reconnaissance followed by infiltration (with combat likely).
Diplomatic reconnaissance followed by assault.
Diplomatic reconnaissance followed by infiltration (with combat
likely).
Set-piece event with direct combat, or with diplomatic or physical
reconnaissance followed by combat. Note: in general, the whole reason behind starting with a set-piece event is to create a viciously fastmoving race against time.
Exploration (physical reconnaissance) involving multiple encounters
(assault, diplomacy, etc)

Aerial Adventures

Table 4-4: Events in the Air

Most aerial adventures contain non-aerial elements, such as a cloud
castle or a cliff-side, although this isn’t necessarily always the case.
What’s meant by an “aerial adventure” here is that the adventure contains significant elements involving flying or falling. These might include travel-type adventures where much of the adventure is a dangerous flying journey to another location, or adventures where flying is a
major tactical element involved in the way the characters must handle
a non-aerial feature. An example of the latter might be a tall cliffside
with many entrances that have no stairways between them, or, even if
the cliff has stairways, there are flying enemies that must be fought off
while getting from one place to another on the cliff.

Note: this is not an encounter table – it is for use in designing significant components of an adventure. An encounter table would need to
have higher likelihood of “normal” events such as a flock of birds, and
lower chances of encountering the weird events such as floating rocks.

This table serves to integrate Table 4-4 (Events in the Air) with the presence of the ground below; when the flight level will be low to the ground
(especially in scouting missions), your adventure will need to take into
account the fact that flying characters can cover a lot of distance and have
much longer visibility ranges than in most other types of adventures.

Castles and ruins will generally be used quite differently from each
other in adventures, since castles are occupied (political or assault-onoccupied-location types of adventures) and ruins are mainly abandoned
(explore-and-loot types of adventures). However, for purposes of getting
ideas, castles and ruins are very similar. Both involve open-air adventuring with a possible aerial component, and the background and physical
design of the adventure locale is a very similar process – since ruins are
usually the broken and abandoned form of a castle-like settlement.

Castellan or Constable

The person ultimately responsible for the functioning of the
castle; the boss.

51-55

Chancellor

A personal secretary to a noble.

56-60

Chaplain

The castle’s religious counselor

Clerk

Responsible for keeping accounts and doing math, as well
as writing. In non-medieval
cultures, a scribe.

Cook and kitchen
staff

The head cook of a castle is
responsible for a very large daily
production, feeding everyone
from servants to soldiers to
nobles.

71-75

Gardener

Gardeners were not just employed to keep vegetable and
herb gardens; they were also
involved in maintaining earthworks and keeping the physical
surroundings of the castle ready
to defend against sieges.

76-80

Jester

The local comic relief

81-85

Keeper of the
Wardrobe

Responsible for the important
clothes, and in charge of laundresses and one or more tailors.

Marshall

In charge of the wagons, horses,
grooms, and all transportation.
Carters and a head groom report
to this officer.

Lord

Although the actual “ownership”
of a castle can vary (emperors
and kings have several castles
they own directly), some noble
will reside in most castles either
as a vassal or as the direct owner.

Porter

Responsible for keeping track
of who enters and leaves the
fortification, and for granting
access. Usually stationed in the
gatehouse, although not normally
part of the actual guard. This is
the person you have to convince,
if you’re trying to sneak in disguised as a group of merchants.

Table 4-17: People in a Castle
The list below is useful because it gives a picture of the castle as a
self-contained community, which (as fortresses) they tend to be. Even
if your campaign isn’t based on the medieval period, and your “castle”
is actually a Pagoda or a clay-brick hill fortress in a Mesopotamian-type
region, these same jobs are likely to exist, just with different names.

Armorer

A skilled blacksmith with the
training and ability to make
weapons and armor

Bailiff

In charge of a village, assigning
jobs to the peasants including
work on the lord’s land and
repairing village structures. Will
not be present in a castle without
a village, and even so would
probably live in the village.
Often a peasant promoted to this
administrative rank; nobles don’t
take this job.

Cities and Settlements
Preparing for a City Adventure

city, and making contact with dangerous people (a thieves guild or assassins guild for example). Tables 1-3 through 1-9 can be very useful if
the characters are looking for work.
Exploration Adventures. In this sort of adventure, the players decide
to wander randomly through the city to see what they find. It is almost impossible to plan for an adventure of this type. To prepare for an
exploration adventure, it is usually best to avoid creating pre-planned
maps of anything, and to rely on random generation tables for most of
the events. Running this type of adventure requires so much creative
mental activity on your part that a random generation tool is often the
only way to keep things moving at a brisk pace. Another tool for running this sort of adventure is to sketch out one or two little locationmaps, just as one would for a mission adventure, but to keep them in
reserve for use wherever and whenever combat actually takes place
(these are often called “geomorphs”). The tables in this book can be
very useful for generating the walk-through of a city map.
Because these three types of city adventures tend to mix and blend in
with each other, the tables in this section aren’t organized as a step-bystep procedure. As you design your adventure, just dip into the tables
for whatever you need at the time.

City adventures are perhaps the most complicated type of adventure
to create, since there is so much activity going on around the characters
at all times. Before trying to design a city adventure, it’s a good idea to
stop and think about why the characters are in the city, and what level
of detail you’re going to need to handle that sort of adventure. If the
adventure is a mere shopping trip, you will bog everything down if you
try to make the players listen to the details of every shop and residence
they see, street by street, with descriptions of the people passing by …
when all they want is to replace a broken longsword and get back to
adventuring.
If this is the first time you have used this city (i.e., it’s not a feature
that has recurred several times in your campaign already), then it’s important to brand something memorable about the city onto the players’
minds. This “capsule” detail about the city should cover two things:
a visual image of the city; and one simple detail about how the city
is risky or gives a significant benefit to the characters themselves, on
a personal level. Players do not remember details – they think about
things in terms of one or two major features. Rather than inundating
them with details to filter, go ahead and smack them with what’s really
memorable right at the beginning. Ideas for the sorts of quirky things
that can make a city memorable are listed in Tables 4-18 to 4-22. As a
general rule, a city should almost be a caricature of itself – focus really,
really hard on the city’s central characteristic, at least until the players
have it drilled into their heads. Once they “know” the city, of course,
you can introduce more details, but still: always slowly enough for the
players to remember!

This is the sort of thing like, “Our town is the cleanest in all the
land…”

There aren’t sharp distinctions between the three types of adventures
listed here – many city adventures are in the gray areas between these
categories. As things get more complicated – which happens because
you offer a “hook” to something more complex, or because the players
decide to interfere more and more in the city’s business – the adventure
will tend to slide closer and closer down the scale toward the exploration type (see below).
Shopping Trips. Shopping trip type adventures aren’t really adventures at all, or, at least, not at the beginning. The players begin this
sort of adventure when they want to buy equipment, get healing, find
information, or undertake some other mundane, non-adventuring type
of activity. Most of the time, you should almost hand-wave this sort of
trip into a city. If the players aren’t trying to gather information or do
anything other than buy things, then you’re only getting in the way if
you try to turn it into an adventure. For this sort of visit to a city, it’s
usually enough to give the players the “capsule information” about the
city, and perhaps a sketch map of the major streets with the important
shops and temples marked.
Mission Adventures. Sometimes, however, the characters are venturing into the city with a mission. Missions normally have two phases: an
information-gathering phase and a combat phase. In the informationgathering phase, tactical information is far less important than knowing
which people have the important information and how the party might
track it down. On the other hand, when the mission turns into combat,
you will usually need to have a very small-scale tactical map of where
the combat will take place. When creating such a map, take advantage
of the features that are unique and special to city adventures: balconies,
multi-story buildings, rooftops, the possibility of using the open sky
above, and bystanders. Depending on the adventure and where it might
lead, it’s possible that you’ll need more than one such map, representing two alternative places where a fight might break out, or for two
places in a “series,” in which the second location is a place the characters will only reach if they are “succeeding” in the adventure. For
a mission adventure, you will need not only the low-detail city map
used in a shopping trip, but also these little pinpoint locations. Mission adventures can include any of the following: looking for work,
performing that work (usually a mission), pursuing a manhunt into the

Odd behaviors have to be something that the Referee can mimic while
the adventurers are talking to people in the city/settlement, or they
won’t make much of an impression on the players. When this works,
however, the players will definitely remember the city. These are cultural behaviors that the entire city (or a subgroup) uses, not just distinctive mannerisms of a single individual.

Table 4-24: City Districts - Continued

City Map Generator
Author’s Favorite Method
The author’s favorite method for inventing a city is to begin by rolling for
the identity of the town’s central open area (Table 4-25), and to assume that
this says a great deal about the city’s personality. A city with its central area
and culture based on a huge graveyard is a very different place from a city
that centers on a gladiatorial arena, which is in turn different from a city
built around a sacred flower-garden. This open area will be large, centrally
located, and it will play a large part in the city’s culture.
Then draw a couple of main streets leading to the city gates from the
central area, and a couple of cross streets so the city map isn’t just one
large hub, and you’re good to go.

Thieves’ Quarter: Few cities would have a quarter
specifically devoted to the profession of larceny, but
some poorer quarters might be dominated by organized
crime and become known for it. Such quarters often
form where part of the city is self-governed or subject to
less onerous laws. Interestingly, theaters were often also
found in such districts.

81-90

Wealthy or Nobles’ District: such districts will contain
partially fortified houses and even small estates, villas, or
compounds comprising several buildings. Many of the
families living in these areas will have troops or retainers, or at the very least a couple of private guardsmen.

Ghetto: not necessarily indicating poverty, a ghetto is
an area where members of a specific race or religion are

require this sort of segregation, or it might simply be that
members of the culture/race/religion prefer to self-segregate, gravitating to the same neighborhoods out of choice.
In particular, foreigners who speak a different language than

Table 4-31: Abstract City-Encounter Generator

Table 4-32: Crimes - Continued

This generator is much too open-ended for use at the gaming table,
but it can be useful for designing your own city encounter tables, if
that’s the way you want to handle running your city. The table defines
the basic outline of the encounter in broad parameters, which can then
be fleshed out.

Holy Ground Only: A piece of land (possibly extremely small) is
known for an event that happened there (possibly it actually did, possibly it is only local legend). People gather there for festivals or on
certain dates unless the place is isolated or in the wilderness. There is a
50% chance that the site has a natural feature. (See table below).
Shrine: A shrine is a man-made place of worship that has no buildings or dedicated priesthood (although priests might stop by, or maintain the shrine from some other location). The shrine is likely a statue
of some kind, although there might be a small structure build to protect
whatever constitutes the shrine. A shrine has a 25% chance to be built
on Holy Ground (see table below), but it would not have a natural feature in addition to the shrine.
Chapel: A chapel is a building (or room) for small worship services.
In some cases (50%) the chapel will have a full-time priest in attendance. If not, a priest from some other location comes to officiate at
services. A historical example of chapels comes from the middle ages,
when noble families would often have private chapels in their castles or
manor houses, with the parish priest coming to hold private services for
the noble family. However, it is quite possible for chapels to be completely separate from other buildings (which is the assumption here). If
there is a full-time priest at the chapel, there is a 20% chance that the
chapel has an Administrative Function in addition to its purely religious
function – see the tables below to determine what that function is. Any
chapel, whether there is a full-time priest or not, has a 30% chance to
be built on Holy Ground, and a 10% chance to house a relic (see table).
Small Temple: A small temple is a Temple Structure containing quarters for priests and a worship area. The temple will have 1d2 priests
and 1d4 acolytes. It has a 40% chance to be built on Holy Ground, a
30% chance to house a relic (see table), and a 30% chance to have an
Administrative Function.
Large Temple: A large temple is a Temple Structure containing quarters for 1d4+1 priests, 1d4+1 acolytes. It has a 60% chance to be built
on Holy Ground, a 60% chance to house a relic, and will have 1d2
Administrative Functions.
Major Temple: A major temple is a Temple Structure containing
quarters for 1d6+6 priests, and 1d6+6 acolytes. It has a 75% chance to

Table 4-43: Cultural Changes in City

Table 4-43: Cultural Changes in City - Continued

In many cases, a city may be undergoing some fundamental change
in its society; if this is the case, the ferment and underlying violence
involved with such a conflict might be an excellent way to provide the
backstory or the specific missions involved in a city adventure.

Die Roll

Type of Cultural Change (d100)

71-80

Technological changes cause or threaten widespread unemployment (introduction of new farming techniques,
more efficient looms for weaving, or even something
more fantastic, like magical sewing needles).

81-90

There is an influx of foreigners from foreign wars or
famines, from movement of nomadic people, or from
new trade routes opening up. Another possibility is
simply that rural peasants are moving into a city because there are more jobs (or vice versa). The “natives”
perceive economic and social risks from the foreigners, and tensions increase, possibly to the point of new
political factions and widespread violence.

91-00

Trade and crafts generate more money than farming,
with the result that trade guilds and merchants begin
pushing their way into the upper classes. Traditional
nobility may respond with laws or even violence against
the “upstarts.” This is also the sort of conflict that leads
to the establishment of new political factions.

Die Roll

Type of Cultural Change (d100)

01-10

A fashion in behavior or dress becomes prevalent.
Perhaps a particular type of fur is a must-have, biting
a dwarf and surviving is a status symbol, owning a pet
jaguar is spiritually enlightening, etc.

11-20

A religious sect is rising rapidly in popularity. Existing,
entrenched temples are forced to respond with changing
approaches and they may try to discredit or outlaw the
popular movement.

21-30

A secular belief begins to spread, causing strife and
intense debate. Examples might include the belief that
a minority group is inherently superior or inferior, that
the common people should have rights (or that they
shouldn’t), that slavery might be immoral (or perhaps
moral), or that certain animals are dangerous.

31-40

New form of music, poetry, art, or sculpture is considered obscene, scandalous, satirically offensive to the
nobility, irreligious, or dangerous to the established
social order.

41-50

51-60

61-70

Table 4-44: The Bill of Fare
Sometimes you may want to mention the “specialty of the house” for
an inn or tavern. This table can give you starting ideas for this rather
mundane task.

New literature or lyric forms are rediscovered by
translators or imported from a foreign country. These
are considered dangerous by traditionalists and those
entrenched in power based on tradition.

Political power vacuum allows a militaristic faction to
increase its power without being checked by the normal
safeguards of society. This might be a militant temple,
followers of a particular noble, the nobility in general,
organized crime, or demagogues.
Social change causes widespread unemployment – an
influx of slaves, the belief that certain forms of work are
demeaning or immoral, the rapid development of a caste
system, etc).

Table 4-47:
Things to Vary on Another Plane of Existence - Continued

Planar Adventures
Notes on Planar Adventures
Planar adventures are difficult to design, but they can produce some of
the most exciting peak moments in a long-running campaign. They often
represent the culmination of some sort of effort, and they are in many
ways the “badge” of an experienced adventuring party. However, what
makes a planar adventure distinct from other adventures is also what
makes it difficult to design – some of the ground rules of normal reality
are changed, which means a lot of pre-planning by the Referee to make
these changes work well as part of an adventure. The adventure needs to
be (a) highly creative in terms of these changes, but also (b) still playable.
If the players can’t quickly grasp what their characters’ new capabilities
and restrictions are, the whole situation will seem random and contrived.
By using these tables, you’ll get ideas for consistent (but weird) physical
rules that might apply across the board in the new plane, or at least in the
area where the adventure takes place. Having the idea established as a “rule”
will help you to build more ideas from it, and will allow you to convey more
easily to the players what their new capabilities, risks, and limitations are.
After you’ve decided what will be “new” in the planar environment, a
good way to make sure it will be a fun setting is to review some of the
basic tenets of the game – if your planar setting takes advantage of these
elements, then you are probably on track:
1) It’s a game of resource management. What unusual resources do
the characters need in this plane/dimension, and how are these used
up? One possible factor in a good planar adventure is an unusual (or
possibly bizarre) resource that the players must decide when to use and
when to conserve. This could range from potions of fire resistance in an
elemental plane, to air supply in an airless pocket dimension, to something like Zo-Tcha eggs that you make up as a truly unique resource.
2) It’s a game of exploration. Beware the tendency to make other
planes of existence into a single type of terrain with little variation and
few landmarks.
3) It’s a game of tactics – have you used the planar/dimensional setting to create unusual tactical challenges with odd combat/spell effects?
4) It’s a game of challenging the players’ skill. Does your planar
adventure only challenge the character sheet (i.e., using saving throws
and damage), or are you also using the setting to create challenges that
can only be solved by smart thinking?

Die Roll

What’s Different on this Plane? (d100)

Varied Factor in Supernatural Plane (d100)

Die Roll

Varied Factor(s) in a Dimension-related Plane (d100)

01-10

Certain terrible events might “replay themselves,”
causing danger to those who are caught up in the echo –
which, to them, would effectively be truly happening.

46-50

Movement: teleportation is the only possible form of
movement (probably mentally controlled, probably with
a small random factor)

11-20

Despair, greed, rage, or other mental state creeps up on
characters if they fail periodic saving throws

51-55

Phasing: random incorporeality

56-60

Phasing: teleportation-type spell effects are altered or
don’t function

21-30

Each encounter with beings in the plane involves a test
of wills, with failure indicating that the loser has come,
to some degree or other, under the control of the other
creature. The characters might have an item that lets
them do the same thing, too – building up an army of
ghouls as they approach the King Wraith’s vast castle…

61-65

Probability: divinatory magic becomes uncertain

66-70

Spell Effect Location: spell effects manifest other than
where intended unless the caster makes some sort of
success check (against intelligence, or a saving throw, or
a to-hit roll). Alternatively, there could be a flat chance
for spells to go off in the location intended.

71-75

Time: Alteration to initiative method

76-80

Time: haste/slow effects, hitting and lasting randomly

81-85

Time: healing rates affected

86-90

Time: move in time as well as space (example: disappear
for 3 rounds, then appear and take 3 full round actions
all at once)

91-95

Time: random aging and reverse-aging

96-00

Time: spell effects manifest slowly or randomly

31-40

Effect on healing or other beneficial clerical-type spells.
If the plane’s ghostly powers are antithetical to certain
religious powers, those powers might be weakened in
the other plane of existence.

41-50

Material plane is visible, but there is a constant risk of
becoming separated from it (either a flat probability
checked at intervals, or actions create a risk of separation to some increasing degree)

51-60

Places may have “echo” powers – one of the main concepts of a supernatural plane is ghostliness, and places
exert compelling powers in many ghost stories.

61-70

Presence of an undead type that is not ordinarily found
in material planes (see Tables 2-64 through 2-68 for
ideas)

71-80

Presence of one normal, living species that one would
not expect to find here. For instance, a wraith world
where normal, living wolves are found. Or small frogs.
Any possibility is a bit spooky; the animals might be
helpful, hostile, or just part of the weirdness of the

Physical Form of Gateway (d100)

Other Aspect of Gateway (d100)

01-10

An item that is worn allows a person to shift into a different plane. For an interesting twist, the item might only have
enough of a “charge” to allow a certain period of time in the
other plane, after which the wearer would be pulled back into
the original plane of existence until the item has recharged and
can be used again.

Having used this particular gate as opposed to another leaves
a visible mark or aura on the characters in the other plane.
Perhaps there is a “slave” gate and a “master” gate – hopefully
the players picked the right one!

11-20

Archway or other architectural feature that the traveler walks
through

Having used this particular gate, as opposed to another, determines the physical form or abilities the characters will have on
the other side. Preferably they picked the “Dragon” gate and
not the “Mouse” gate, for example.

awakens and banishes the party into the realm of ghosts…

31-40

Consuming some item, such as a lotus blossom

The manner in which the gateway is used actually creates the
other plane rather than simply “reaching” it.

41-50

No physical aspect; travel to the other plane is accomplished
mentally or by use of a spell, incantation, or similar spoken
ritual. The physical body might or might not be left behind.

Use of the gateway creates a physical effect (all the way from a
little alarm bell up to possibly a massive earthquake) somewhere in one of the two planes.

51-60

Performing a series of acts, normally with particular physical
components such as a flint blade, a particular incense, etc.

71-80

Remaining in a particular place for a certain length of time.
In this sort of circumstance, the characters might even “feel”
themselves slowly changing their plane of reality.

No particular other aspect of the gateway.

81-90

Touching a physical item such as a magical tree, an ancient
statue, or other such.

No particular other aspect of the gateway.

Travel is accomplished in a vehicle of some kind; often a ship,

Part Two: Desert Wilderness Tables Table 4-82: Desert Map Features - Continued
Deserts are actually a lot more interesting than the featureless seas
of sand many people think of. There are several different types of deserts, and they are populated with an extraordinary variety of plant and
animal life (although more sparsely than the more hospitable terrain
types). One particular thing to keep in mind about deserts is that sand
moves constantly as a result of wind currents – you can always use the
adventure hook of something interesting that has recently been uncovered by the winds.

Table 4-81: Types of Deserts
Die Roll

01-14

15-28

Desert
Type

Description

Coastal
Desert

Coastal deserts are created because of
cold ocean currents running parallel to the
coastline. Such deserts often experience
ground-covering fog, but little precipitation.

Midlatitude
Desert

Areas located far from oceans, and are
watersheds which receive little rainfall.
Temperatures in midlatitude deserts vary
considerably with the season, rather than
being tremendously hot all the time. The
Tengger Desert in China, and the Sonoran
Desert in Mexico are examples of this sort
of desert.

29-42

Monsoon
Desert

Monsoon deserts are areas where seasonal
storms run out of moisture before reaching
the desert area.

43-56

Montaine
Desert

Montaine deserts are high-altitude areas
far from any significant body of water.
The Tibetan plateau contains a significant
area of Montaine Desert.

Polar
Desert

Deserts in polar regions are generally
plains of gravel or plain bedrock rather
than sand. In polar deserts where precipitation occurs, there can be incidence of
snow dunes.

71-84

Rain
Shadow
Desert

A tall mountain range blocks clouds from
moving into the desert region. The Tian
Shan Desert in China is an example of a
Rain Shadow Desert

85-100

Trade Wind
Desert

Predominant wind currents heat up and
dissipate cloud cover, causing more sun to
hit the area. The Sahara is an example of
this type of desert.

57-70

01-07

Desert
Feature

Description

Badlands
(clay-rich
area)

Arid areas with high clay content eroded
by wind or water are called badlands. They
have a number of unique geographical
features including canyons, gullies, and
hoodoos. A hoodoo is a tall spire of rock left
behind after the surrounding area is eroded
away. Many of these form because there
is a more durable rock at the top, acting as
a “cap” to protect the lower portion of the
spire from the elements.

Desert
Feature

Description

08-14

Dunes

Dunes can form from snow in polar deserts,
and from sand in hotter deserts. They have a
gentle slope on one side and a steeper slope
on the lee side (where the blown-over sand
causes avalanches).

15-22

Dust
Devils

Cyclonic storms of very small particles,
reaching as high as one kilometer. Caused
by extreme temperature differentials in close
areas.

23-30

Ephemeral
Stream

Runoff from nearby mountains can cause
short-lived rivers or streams in a desert

Exotic
River

Most deserts are watersheds which receive
little moisture (the moisture all goes to the
adjoining watersheds). However, in some
cases a river with a very strong source, such
as the Nile or the Colorado River, moves
through a desert.

38-44

Lakes

Desert lakes can form when there is sufficient runoff from nearby mountains. They
are shallow and broad, and wind can actually cause the lake to move from one place
to another.

45-52

Loess

Silt deposits, often as deep as 20-30 meters,
with one deposit 355 meters deep.

Mineral
Deposits

Deserts contain metals no less than temperate regions, so it is possible to find valuable
gold, silver, or copper deposits. In particular, though, deserts have unusual mineral
deposits caused by evaporation. Not all of
these would be particularly interesting in
a fantasy campaign, but unusual salts and
other minerals might be used in magical
potions, making expeditions into the desert a
worthwhile venture.

61-68

Oasis

An oasis is an area where underground
springs or seepage can create small lakes,
tree growth, and crop growth in areas where
precipitation alone would not permit crop
growth. The soils are not usually very good;
they are high in organic content, but often
saline. However, it would be possible to
have an oasis where the soil was incredibly
fertile – it’s just not likely under real-world
terrestrial conditions.

69-76

Playa

Flat area caused by the existence of a dry
desert lakebed. Usually crusted with salt or
clay as a result of the lake’s presence.

77-84

Ripples

Ripples can be as large as small dunes, but
don’t necessarily have the gentle slope/ steep
slope formation of a true dune.

85-92

Flat sand. Boring, but this is what covers
about 40% of deserts, as opposed to areas
with dunes. The reason why dunes don’t
Sand Sheet
form is because the sand particles in a sand
sheet are too large for significant wind
movement.
